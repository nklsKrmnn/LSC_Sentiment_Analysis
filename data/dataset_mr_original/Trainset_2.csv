1848;1849;38758;Parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults .;4
2120;2121;43733;One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .;1
1648;1649;35065;Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .;1

1228;1229;26772;This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel , Seth Green and Barry Pepper .;2
1577;1578;33637;A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .;4
1895;1896;39701;Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .;1
2028;2029;42159;Ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies .;2
1544;1545;32983;But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .;0
1973;1974;41175;It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless .;3

1329;1330;28708;A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .;1
1809;1810;38049;-LRB- Shyamalan -RRB- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .;3
1609;1610;34273;As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .;4
2006;2007;41699;The sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .;2
1712;1713;36243;The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .;1
1156;1157;25307;The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .;1
1701;1702;36082;Yet the act is still charming here .;3
1970;1971;41117;One suspects that Craven endorses They simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .;1
1434;1435;30836;It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .;3
2013;2014;41840;The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .;1
1516;1517;32368;Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .;1
1492;1493;31881;Starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and Bruce Willis with a scar .;0
1958;1959;40888;Ruh-roh !;2
1676;1677;35582;"At its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .";2
1610;1611;34299;Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .;4
1694;1695;35919;Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .;2
2086;2087;43198;It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .;2
1896;1897;39720;A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .;1
1823;1824;38311;A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .;0
1265;1266;27531;An intelligently made -LRB- and beautifully edited -RRB- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the Hollywood pipeline without a hitch .;4
1581;1582;33682;Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .;1
1980;1981;41276;So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .;0
1644;1645;34955;Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .;1
1283;1284;27970;A Frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , Bartleby performs neither one very well .;2
1894;1895;39691;Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .;0
1620;1621;34508;... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .;2
1372;1373;29613;There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .;0
1335;1336;28801;Like many Western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about North Korea 's recent past and South Korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight .;3
1442;1443;30961;A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .;0
1639;1640;34834;Like its title character , this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .;3
1529;1530;32630;The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .;0
1917;1918;40046;Rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material .;3
1789;1790;37643;Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break .;1
1377;1378;29757;Funny and touching .;3
2049;2050;42511;A strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of Wladyslaw Szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being .;4
1532;1533;32692;Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .;0
2033;2034;42225;The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .;3
2067;2068;42823;LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .;2
1641;1642;34899;Film ca n't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout .;2
1098;1099;24178;The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .;0
2042;2043;42381;Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .;2
1359;1360;29348;After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .;0
2060;2061;42688;Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .;0
1281;1282;27919;We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .;1
1599;1600;34049;Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .;0
1820;1821;38252;Writer \/ director M. Night Shyamalan 's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable .;3
1715;1716;36311;It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .;3
1511;1512;32254;Jackson is always watchable .;3
1631;1632;34705;Some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the Ball and Chain .;2
2036;2037;42289;The date movie that Franz Kafka would have made .;2
1381;1382;29800;It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .;1
1080;1081;23778;For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . ';0
1679;1680;35677;When the twist endings were actually surprising ?;2
1376;1377;29716;The power of Shanghai Ghetto , a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s .;3
1276;1277;27804;A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .;0
1830;1831;38435;would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .;2
1673;1674;35542;The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .;0
1160;1161;25379;Befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject;1
1782;1783;37516;Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .;0
1918;1919;40056;For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .;1
1834;1835;38505;Intriguing and stylish .;4
1663;1664;35399;A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .;4
1687;1688;35770;`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .;0
1436;1437;30873;There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .;2
1547;1548;33032;It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .;0
1372;1373;29613;There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .;0
1842;1843;38655;What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .;1
1559;1560;33293;So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .;0
1851;1852;38827;Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .;2
1876;1877;39314;The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .;4
1833;1834;38501;Poignant and delicately complex .;3
1508;1509;32213;It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .;2
1987;1988;41367;Clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable ...;3
1463;1464;31315;Insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it does n't disgrace it , either .;2
1518;1519;32397;Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .;1
1501;1502;32079;Qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere .;2
1350;1351;29183;This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .;4
1824;1825;38331;Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .;1
1114;1115;24514;Truly terrible .;0
1675;1676;35579;Gently humorous and touching .;3
1385;1386;29898;The simplicity of The Way Home has few equals this side of Aesop;2
1588;1589;33799;Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .;2
1757;1758;37080;Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .;4
2003;2004;41638;Director David Jacobson gives Dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims .;2
1141;1142;25040;Discursive but oddly riveting documentary .;3
1461;1462;31299;Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .;0
1922;1923;40141;Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of Hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .;1
1863;1864;39045;Leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .;3
1985;1986;41345;Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .;1
1171;1172;25649;It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .;0
2108;2109;43561;-- but certainly hard to hate .;3
1428;1429;30714;I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .;0
1487;1488;31757;Just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer .;4
1383;1384;29864;A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .;1

2101;2102;43480;Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .;2
2091;2092;43301;is one of this year 's very best pictures .;4
1148;1149;25123;Elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy .;4
1735;1736;36663;Some movies blend together as they become distant memories .;2
2010;2011;41751;Smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country .;3
1643;1644;34935;A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded Elvis fans -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- will have fun with .;4
2025;2026;42079;An odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the Midwest that held my interest precisely because it did n't try to .;4
1178;1179;25763;A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .;2
1552;1553;33119;All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .;2
1570;1571;33490;To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...;1
2111;2112;43622;Good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make Paid in Full worth seeing .;4
1566;1567;33412;Grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to Toback 's Heidegger - and Nietzsche-referencing dialogue .;4
2008;2009;41729;Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .;0
2114;2115;43647;Beautifully produced .;4
1341;1342;28959;Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .;1
1835;1836;38508;It was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .;2
2018;2019;41979;fast , frantic and fun , but also soon forgotten;2
2020;2021;41990;To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .;0
1130;1131;24801;Matthew Lillard is born to play Shaggy !;4
1813;1814;38152;Saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .;3
1394;1395;30052;This thing is virtually unwatchable .;0
1118;1119;24566;If the very concept makes you nervous ... you 'll have an idea of the film 's creepy , scary effectiveness .;2
1988;1989;41380;Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .;4
1068;1069;23581;Blue Crush is as predictable as the tides .;1
1636;1637;34790;An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship .;4
1951;1952;40726;The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side .;1
1418;1419;30532;Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .;0
1192;1193;26059;Wait for it to hit cable .;2
1188;1189;25968;Even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , Spy Kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man .;1
1751;1752;36986;One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .;1
1793;1794;37715;... a bland , pretentious mess .;1
1157;1158;25344;It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .;1
1513;1514;32271;Terry is a sort of geriatric Dirty Harry , which will please Eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man .;3
1187;1188;25934;The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible IMAX sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes .;4
1579;1580;33653;A soul-stirring documentary about the Israeli\/Palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds .;4
1324;1325;28643;Enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast .;4
1532;1533;32692;Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .;0
1667;1668;35433;Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .;1
1952;1953;40751;Anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning .;1
1254;1255;27300;LaBute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : He 's changed the male academic from a lower-class Brit to an American , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .;2
1399;1400;30165;Everybody loves a David and Goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from David 's point of view .;3
1558;1559;33275;A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire .;4
1116;1117;24537;Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .;1
1764;1765;37205;But it would be better to wait for the video .;1
1649;1650;35087;Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White 's dry wit to a new age .;4
2053;2054;42580;The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and Kurys ' direction is clever and insightful .;4
1333;1334;28774;Trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease .;2
1177;1178;25762;Amazing !;4
1555;1556;33191;A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .;2
1663;1664;35399;A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .;4
1382;1383;29820;A stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world 's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making .;4
1368;1369;29550;Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .;0
1505;1506;32143;A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .;0
1949;1950;40682;In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .;2
1915;1916;40013;A full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence .;3
1760;1761;37142;Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .;2
1703;1704;36096;It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...;4
1154;1155;25269;This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .;1
1538;1539;32847;The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .;3
2016;2017;41923;... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .;0
2034;2035;42266;Bring on the sequel .;3
1263;1264;27515;The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .;1
1954;1955;40790;... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .;0
1290;1291;28088;In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .;2
1140;1141;25015;The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .;0
1657;1658;35255;When twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we 'd live in if Argento 's Hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve .;3
1435;1436;30847;The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .;4
1846;1847;38749;O.K. , not really .;2
1652;1653;35158;It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .;0
1292;1293;28133;After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .;2
1637;1638;34808;A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .;0
1378;1379;29759;There is nothing redeeming about this movie .;0
1203;1204;26287;Watching E.T now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .;2
1733;1734;36619;Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .;3
1212;1213;26445;The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .;1
1720;1721;36393;Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .;0
1606;1607;34184;The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .;0
1282;1283;27943;An ebullient Tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing .;3
1179;1180;25799;Wow , so who knew Charles Dickens could be so light-hearted ?;3
2064;2065;42779;Beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images .;3
1545;1546;32996;Jason Patric and Ray Liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .;4
1706;1707;36132;A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .;1
1678;1679;35647;Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .;2
1165;1166;25478;At its best when the guarded , resentful Betty and the manipulative yet needy Margot are front and center .;2
1795;1796;37730;Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .;3
1645;1646;34982;Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved;0
1404;1405;30273;It 's just not very smart .;1
1508;1509;32213;It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .;2
1107;1108;24374;Assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation .;3
1452;1453;31128;Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .;0
1981;1982;41301;The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .;2
1843;1844;38679;"Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .";0
2090;2091;43283;while -LRB- Roman Coppola -RRB- scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story .;2
2007;2008;41715;What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?;1
1572;1573;33527;Vividly demonstrates that the director of such Hollywood blockbusters as Patriot Games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop .;4
1259;1260;27452;... a light , yet engrossing piece .;3
1660;1661;35330;But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .;0
1078;1079;23726;Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .;1
1726;1727;36511;Ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .;3
1117;1118;24562;Anemic , pretentious .;1
1318;1319;28524;The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . '';1
1765;1766;37215;Delirious fun .;4
1856;1857;38933;Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .;2
1608;1609;34234;Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .;2
1615;1616;34414;A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .;0
1444;1445;31004;This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie I 've seen this summer .;1
1835;1836;38508;It was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .;2
1461;1462;31299;Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .;0
1316;1317;28468;The film truly does rescue -LRB- the Funk Brothers -RRB- from Motown 's shadows .;2
1869;1870;39195;Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda .;1
1180;1181;25814;Hey , Happy !;3
1543;1544;32947;As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .;0
1387;1388;29931;The film is saved from are n't - kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked and a stately sense of composition .;3
2119;2120;43714;Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest .;0
1707;1708;36157;A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .;2
1529;1530;32630;The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .;0
1358;1359;29301;With three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it 's enough to make you wish Jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .;2
1874;1875;39286;Boring and meandering .;0
1825;1826;38347;is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .;2
1664;1665;35413;It is a movie about passion .;2
1762;1763;37178;Murder by Numbers ' is n't a great movie , but it 's a perfectly acceptable widget .;2
1886;1887;39515;The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .;1
1670;1671;35502;A fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion .;3
1163;1164;25427;The best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites .;3
2081;2082;43108;Elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy .;3
1232;1233;26874;It is n't scary .;1
1211;1212;26418;Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .;1
1975;1976;41216;Enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise .;3
1815;1816;38186;Tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here .;3
1593;1594;33930;What you end up getting is the Vertical Limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .;2
1076;1077;23699;If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , Jacquot preserves Tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .;3
1446;1447;31041;`` Red Dragon '' is entertaining .;4
1827;1828;38382;The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .;1
1168;1169;25571;Sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy ... Attal looks so much like a young Robert DeNiro that it seems the film should instead be called ` My Husband Is Travis Bickle ' .;4
1427;1428;30697;... gripping and handsome execution , -LRB- but -RRB- there is n't much about K-19 that 's unique or memorable .;2
1134;1135;24886;In between all the emotional seesawing , it 's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived .;1
1253;1254;27266;It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .;1
1992;1993;41452;The dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . ';2
1083;1084;23851;Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .;1
1885;1886;39491;Texan director George Ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .;4
1500;1501;32062;Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .;0
1695;1696;35934;Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .;0
1920;1921;40102;Kinnear 's performance is a career-defining revelation .;4
2050;2051;42547;Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .;2
1998;1999;41521;A French film with a more down-home flavor .;3
1114;1115;24514;Truly terrible .;0
1340;1341;28940;But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .;2
2041;2042;42376;Mild , meandering teen flick .;2
2096;2097;43378;Visually striking and viscerally repellent .;3
1143;1144;25057;This movie got me grinning .;3
1209;1210;26386;A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .;0

1807;1808;38020;At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes .;2
1273;1274;27742;A college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing !;3
1395;1396;30057;The movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds .;3
1994;1995;41480;An empty , purposeless exercise .;0
1084;1085;23882;Family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking .;3
1447;1448;31046;Quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor .;3
1691;1692;35855;The worst film of the year .;0
1855;1856;38914;Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .;0
1118;1119;24566;If the very concept makes you nervous ... you 'll have an idea of the film 's creepy , scary effectiveness .;2
2130;2131;43967;Spielberg 's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later .;4
1736;1737;36672;Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .;0
1826;1827;38364;For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .;0
1280;1281;27884;After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .;1

1787;1788;37621;Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .;1
1613;1614;34374;It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .;2

1108;1109;24387;Those who are only mildly curious , I fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .;1

1140;1141;25015;The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .;0
1442;1443;30961;A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .;0
1530;1531;32661;At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .;1

2023;2024;42046;An energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it is n't .;3

1592;1593;33922;Every joke is repeated at least four times .;1
1766;1767;37218;There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .;1
1183;1184;25842;More than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology ...;2
2107;2108;43543;Sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .;1
1977;1978;41235;Sweet gentle Jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?;1

1338;1339;28881;The Trinity Assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and George Ratliff 's documentary , Hell House , reflects their earnestness -- which makes for a terrifying film .;2
2030;2031;42183;A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .;2
1579;1580;33653;A soul-stirring documentary about the Israeli\/Palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds .;4

2038;2039;42312;Frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the Kahlo movie Frida fans have been looking for .;2

2045;2046;42447;... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .;2
2099;2100;43424;The tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons .;2
1350;1351;29183;This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .;4
1880;1881;39380;It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .;1
1858;1859;38957;If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .;1

1926;1927;40190;The delicious trimmings ... arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability to triumph over a Scrooge or two .;4
1672;1673;35521;This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .;2

1454;1455;31157;Some may choose to interpret the film 's end as hopeful or optimistic but I think Payne is after something darker .;2

1254;1255;27300;LaBute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : He 's changed the male academic from a lower-class Brit to an American , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .;2
1603;1604;34148;That 's because relatively nothing happens .;1
1195;1196;26104;But they fascinate in their recklessness .;3
1367;1368;29515;This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . ';0

1543;1544;32947;As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .;0

2014;2015;41855;Birthday Girl lucks out with Chaplin and Kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns .;3
1893;1894;39666;De Ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .;2
1961;1962;40938;A dreary indulgence .;2
1966;1967;41019;Though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed .;2

1309;1310;28362;Ya-Yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film .;3
1812;1813;38116;Like Shrek , Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .;4
1629;1630;34676;The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .;4

1683;1684;35728;A compelling film .;4
1170;1171;25633;A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .;0
1904;1905;39869;What the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance .;3
1085;1086;23905;A poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .;4

1507;1508;32179;Nicole Kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that Birthday Girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while .;3

2000;2001;41556;It 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .;0
2047;2048;42478;Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .;0

1665;1666;35418;Certainly .;2
1245;1246;27098;Their work is fantastic .;4
1982;1983;41318;It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .;0
1354;1355;29266;Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .;0
2097;2098;43384;Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .;1
1356;1357;29287;In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .;0
1995;1996;41485;Offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in .;1
1957;1958;40873;Famuyiwa 's feature;2
1518;1519;32397;Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .;1
1461;1462;31299;Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .;0
1794;1795;37721;The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .;0
1769;1770;37272;A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .;2
1686;1687;35747;Yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it 's so fascinating you wo n't be able to look away for a second .;3
1836;1837;38530;It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .;1
1770;1771;37316;`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .;0
1291;1292;28124;The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .;0
1945;1946;40652;Enigma lacks it .;1
1777;1778;37446;One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning .;4
1475;1476;31534;The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card .;1
1470;1471;31432;A tasty slice of droll whimsy .;2
1488;1489;31770;It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .;4
1741;1742;36747;As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .;0
2011;2012;41779;For 95 often hilarious minutes;3
1576;1577;33596;Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .;4
1355;1356;29271;Does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story .;3
1889;1890;39596;The Wild Thornberrys Movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough .;3
1144;1145;25062;The film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .;2
1369;1370;29561;The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .;4
1319;1320;28564;A playful Iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences .;3
1292;1293;28133;After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .;2
1925;1926;40186;It 's not hateful .;2
1176;1177;25754;Where the film falters is in its tone .;1
1389;1390;29972;Like any good romance , Son of the Bride , proves it 's never too late to learn .;3
1838;1839;38589;A biopic about Crane 's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video .;2
2040;2041;42352;Neither the funniest film that Eddie Murphy nor Robert De Niro has ever made , Showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while .;3
1540;1541;32888;It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .;3
1794;1795;37721;The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .;0
1340;1341;28940;But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .;2
1468;1469;31415;You have to see it .;4
1142;1143;25046;This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head;1
1192;1193;26059;Wait for it to hit cable .;2
1934;1935;40466;... a pretentious mess ...;0
1256;1257;27357;Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .;2
1086;1087;23923;Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .;2
1354;1355;29266;Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .;0
1303;1304;28288;Otherwise , maybe .;2
1482;1483;31638;Brian Tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .;4
1772;1773;37374;This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time .;4
1822;1823;38300;This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .;1
1908;1909;39931;A deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph .;3
1317;1318;28483;Director Chris Wedge and screenwriters Michael Berg , Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage Looney Tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time .;3
1231;1232;26844;Blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch-perfect Holden .;4
1684;1685;35730;The movie is well done , but slow .;1
1483;1484;31665;Uplifting , funny and wise .;3
1550;1551;33075;If you 're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake .;1
1907;1908;39918;... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .;0
1551;1552;33103;Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .;2
1630;1631;34690;It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .;2
1533;1534;32720;Wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film .;3
1891;1892;39640;Throw Smoochy from the train !;1
1235;1236;26931;Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .;1
1844;1845;38713;Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .;0
1898;1899;39754;It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .;4
1960;1961;40915;directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name;2
1451;1452;31119;As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .;3
1521;1522;32469;While Insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , Nolan 's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends -LRB- it -RRB- stimulating depth .;3
1599;1600;34049;Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .;0
1669;1670;35476;This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground .;4
1800;1801;37864;Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .;1
1792;1793;37701;It 's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn .;3
1780;1781;37495;What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .;1
1327;1328;28688;Funny in a sick , twisted sort of way .;3
1799;1800;37851;The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .;4
1498;1499;32030;Yes , soar .;3
1098;1099;24178;The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .;0
1270;1271;27678;Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up .;4
1261;1262;27475;unpretentious , charming , quirky , original;4
1834;1835;38505;Intriguing and stylish .;4
1994;1995;41480;An empty , purposeless exercise .;0
1321;1322;28601;You can taste it , but there 's no fizz .;1
1246;1247;27102;As a movie , it never seems fresh and vital .;2
1838;1839;38589;A biopic about Crane 's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video .;2
1349;1350;29168;This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .;1
1546;1547;33011;This often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal .;4
1452;1453;31128;Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .;0
2118;2119;43703;Grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors .;2
1867;1868;39155;Five screenwriters;2
1577;1578;33637;A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .;4
1443;1444;30977;Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .;1
1777;1778;37446;One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning .;4
1597;1598;34017;, is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly .;3
2087;2088;43221;It 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .;4
1403;1404;30232;It has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .;3
1660;1661;35330;But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .;0
1534;1535;32736;Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .;2
1983;1984;41328;Laughably , irredeemably awful .;0
1126;1127;24721;The Sundance Film Festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon Utah each January to ferret out The Next Great Thing .;2
2075;2076;42978;Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .;2
1486;1487;31723;These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and I 'm all for that .;3
1247;1248;27112;Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .;0
1864;1865;39061;The rich performances by Friel -- and especially Williams , an American actress who becomes fully English -- round out the square edges .;3
1304;1305;28291;While the path may be familiar , first-time director Denzel Washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting .;3
1874;1875;39286;Boring and meandering .;0
1352;1353;29230;A beautifully observed character piece .;4
1796;1797;37765;The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .;1
1216;1217;26518;This version moves beyond the original 's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema 's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .;2
1202;1203;26254;The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .;2
1601;1602;34090;Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .;1
2025;2026;42079;An odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the Midwest that held my interest precisely because it did n't try to .;4
1450;1451;31097;Fear permeates the whole of Stortelling , Todd Solondz ' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .;3
1737;1738;36695;Chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . ';3
1808;1809;38035;Bill Morrison 's Decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .;4
1430;1431;30747;"... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 's ... The film 's ending has a `` What was it all for ? ''";0
1728;1729;36547;At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -LRB- depending upon where you live -RRB- , Ignorant Fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .;3
1240;1241;27006;Maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor .;4
1415;1416;30485;A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .;2
1207;1208;26355;A party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid .;1
1731;1732;36601;It 's just merely very bad .;0
1791;1792;37689;Richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings .;4
1873;1874;39270;Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .;1
1802;1803;37899;` Tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of The Next Pretty Good Thing .;2
1347;1348;29121;` Drumline ' shows a level of young , Black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated .;4
1209;1210;26386;A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .;0
1267;1268;27603;Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane .;1
1159;1160;25374;A cockeyed shot all the way .;1
1502;1503;32094;has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a `` 2 '' at the end of its title .;3
1878;1879;39361;Why ?;1
1432;1433;30814;Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .;1
1351;1352;29209;All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .;1
1564;1565;33382;A lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe .;3
1455;1456;31179;Scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern Lothario .;4
1210;1211;26398;Astonishing ... -LRB- frames -RRB- profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment .;4
1854;1855;38885;Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .;3
1910;1911;39960;Predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director John Stockwell .;3
1772;1773;37374;This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time .;4
2098;2099;43397;The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .;1
2132;2133;43992;Fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film .;4
2102;2103;43503;A pale Xerox of other , better crime movies .;1
1565;1566;33398;Miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .;4
1587;1588;33763;... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .;0
1607;1608;34218;The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .;2
1700;1701;36056;Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles .;4
1755;1756;37062;Elvira fans could hardly ask for more .;4
1967;1968;41046;When the precise nature of Matthew 's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .;2
1943;1944;40589;It is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter .;4
1868;1869;39170;About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .;1
1704;1705;36113;He drags it back , single-handed .;3
2026;2027;42110;Australian actor\/director John Polson and award-winning English cinematographer Giles Nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation .;3

1122;1123;24651;The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .;1
1135;1136;24915;The combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives Italian for Beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .;2
1614;1615;34390;One of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society .;3
1658;1659;35294;But it 's worth the concentration .;3
1571;1572;33501;... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .;1
2063;2064;42759;Tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star .;4
2047;2048;42478;Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .;0
1759;1760;37117;... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .;0
1626;1627;34627;What begins as a film in the tradition of The Graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .;2
1954;1955;40790;... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .;0
1274;1275;27757;There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .;0
1162;1163;25404;The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .;0

1491;1492;31838;That ` Alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of Witherspoon -LRB- who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate -RRB- ...;3

1422;1423;30617;"The history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling .";4
1743;1744;36799;For all the dolorous trim , Secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop Freudianism .;3
2103;2104;43513;It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .;0
1189;1190;25999;The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .;0
1158;1159;25357;As a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , Sex with Strangers is a success .;3
2037;2038;42299;This charming , thought-provoking New York fest of life and love has its rewards .;4
1955;1956;40812;Both Grant and Hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .;3
1275;1276;27776;All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .;1
1862;1863;39039;On its own , it 's not very interesting .;1
1478;1479;31575;Stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .;3
1531;1532;32688;What is the filmmakers ' point ?;2
1801;1802;37884;An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .;1
2038;2039;42312;Frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the Kahlo movie Frida fans have been looking for .;2
1464;1465;31336;No. .;1
1941;1942;40558;Adaptation 's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary .;4
1642;1643;34913;It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .;3
1299;1300;28238;This is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .;1
1826;1827;38364;For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .;0
1769;1770;37272;A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .;2
1696;1697;35947;A raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted Korean American stand-up 's I 'm the One That I Want .;3

1549;1550;33062;It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .;1
1361;1362;29400;Formuliac , but fun .;3
1493;1494;31913;World Traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .;3
1360;1361;29387;Could n't someone take Rob Schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?;1
1485;1486;31705;A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .;0
1982;1983;41318;It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .;0
1755;1756;37062;Elvira fans could hardly ask for more .;4
1903;1904;39839;The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .;2
1598;1599;34032;You may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject .;3
1097;1098;24145;Filmmaker Stacy Peralta has a flashy editing style that does n't always jell with Sean Penn 's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it .;3
1534;1535;32736;Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .;2
1967;1968;41046;When the precise nature of Matthew 's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .;2
1348;1349;29142;"This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .";0
1980;1981;41276;So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .;0
1541;1542;32912;Like Kissing Jessica Stein , Amy 's Orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor .;3
1882;1883;39416;Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .;1
1201;1202;26227;It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .;3
1186;1187;25895;Like Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .;0
1629;1630;34676;The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .;4
1939;1940;40532;All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .;2
1467;1468;31401;At 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth .;4
1288;1289;28050;As home movie gone haywire , it 's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , I 'd rather listen to old Tori Amos records .;2
1090;1091;24028;Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .;0
1300;1301;28255;there is truth here;3
2057;2058;42660;Full of surprises .;3
2086;2087;43198;It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .;2
1455;1456;31179;Scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern Lothario .;4
1306;1307;28324;Throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh .;4
2074;2075;42967;At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .;3
1767;1768;37234;Special P.O.V. camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense IMAX screen .;4
1589;1590;33846;The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .;2
1788;1789;37639;And Vin Diesel is the man .;3
1566;1567;33412;Grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to Toback 's Heidegger - and Nietzsche-referencing dialogue .;4
2067;2068;42823;LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .;2
1413;1414;30453;For almost the first two-thirds of Martin Scorsese 's 168-minute Gangs of New York , I was entranced .;3
1569;1570;33478;A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .;0
1079;1080;23749;The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .;1
1972;1973;41148;is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House .;0
2129;2130;43936;The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .;4
1214;1215;26490;Oh , look at that clever angle !;3
1609;1610;34273;As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .;4
1600;1601;34071;On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .;2
2090;2091;43283;while -LRB- Roman Coppola -RRB- scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story .;2
1362;1363;29405;What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .;0
1474;1475;31514;Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .;1
1522;1523;32501;The Pianist -LRB- is -RRB- a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life .;4
1844;1845;38713;Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .;0
1851;1852;38827;Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .;2
1881;1882;39393;A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .;0
1655;1656;35209;No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .;1
1233;1234;26877;And it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .;3
2088;2089;43231;... strips Bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults .;3
1806;1807;37997;It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .;3
1213;1214;26461;If you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , Sweet Home Alabama is diverting in the manner of Jeff Foxworthy 's stand-up act .;2
1574;1575;33579;It 's still terrible !;0
1799;1800;37851;The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .;4
1702;1703;36089;The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .;1
2112;2113;43635;An honest , sensitive story from a Vietnamese point of view .;4
1874;1875;39286;Boring and meandering .;0
1790;1791;37669;While there are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it does n't .;3
2087;2088;43221;It 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .;4
2114;2115;43647;Beautifully produced .;4
1659;1660;35301;Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . ';1
2051;2052;42554;-LRB- A -RRB- soulless , stupid sequel ...;0
2054;2055;42598;It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .;1
1773;1774;37382;Auto Focus is not your standard Hollywood bio-pic .;2
2001;2002;41592;Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?;1
1721;1722;36408;Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .;0
1714;1715;36285;"... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .";0
1370;1371;29582;An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .;0
1768;1769;37260;There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .;4
1927;1928;40235;Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .;1
1862;1863;39039;On its own , it 's not very interesting .;1
1190;1191;26032;None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .;2
1791;1792;37689;Richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings .;4
1390;1391;29988;One of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but ... also one of the most curiously depressing .;3
1638;1639;34826;A stylistic romp that 's always fun to watch .;4
2132;2133;43992;Fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film .;4
1104;1105;24316;Everyone 's to blame here .;1
1662;1663;35373;The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .;1
1105;1106;24321;Instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions .;3
1109;1110;24415;What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .;0
1716;1717;36334;I like it .;3
1330;1331;28722;A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .;0
1112;1113;24452;The evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear .;3
1519;1520;32424;Time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness .;4
2066;2067;42815;Cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh .;4
1901;1902;39786;A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .;0
2062;2063;42736;Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .;0
1885;1886;39491;Texan director George Ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .;4
1128;1129;24762;What a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is .;4
1685;1686;35736;It is up to you to decide if you need to see it .;2
2116;2117;43667;A film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers .;4
1167;1168;25543;I wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` Slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but I laughed so much that I did n't mind .;2
1110;1111;24431;At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .;4
2113;2114;43646;Who knew ...;2
1278;1279;27848;In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition;1
1453;1454;31143;You wo n't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these Veggies .;3
1722;1723;36424;A knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite Son of the Bride .;4
1673;1674;35542;The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .;0
1137;1138;24973;Good-naturedly cornball sequel .;3
1208;1209;26366;A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .;4
1264;1265;27526;A dazzling dream of a documentary .;4
1881;1882;39393;A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .;0
2092;2093;43308;Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .;3
1964;1965;40982;I ca n't remember the last time I saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in Extreme Ops .;1
1620;1621;34508;... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .;2
1230;1231;26833;Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .;1

1396;1397;30104;What a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride .;4
1933;1934;40445;In -LRB- screenwriter -RRB- Charlie Kaufman 's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking .;2
1367;1368;29515;This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . ';0
2021;2022;42015;Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .;1
1072;1073;23619;A compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother 's hold over her .;3
2046;2047;42464;Exposing the ways we fool ourselves is One Hour Photo 's real strength .;2
1782;1783;37516;Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .;0
1708;1709;36172;of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation;3
1274;1275;27757;There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .;0
1291;1292;28124;The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .;0
1075;1076;23682;Jagger , Stoppard and director Michael Apted ... deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride .;4
1482;1483;31638;Brian Tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .;4
1100;1101;24214;Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?;0
1906;1907;39906;an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? '';2
1133;1134;24860;Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .;1
1526;1527;32552;While I ca n't say it 's on par with the first one , Stuart Little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie .;3
1090;1091;24028;Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .;0
1277;1278;27827;Once the downward spiral comes to pass , Auto Focus bears out as your typical junkie opera ...;1
1580;1581;33677;Certainly the performances are worthwhile .;3
1139;1140;25006;And that is where Ararat went astray .;1
1950;1951;40712;Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .;0
1162;1163;25404;The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .;0
1861;1862;39016;that it 'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture;3
1674;1675;35564;This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .;1
1490;1491;31818;A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .;1
1831;1832;38450;This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .;0
1647;1648;35037;The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .;1
1234;1235;26913;Like a fish that 's lived too long , Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .;1
1753;1754;37025;Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .;1
1441;1442;30939;In my opinion , Analyze That is not as funny or entertaining as Analyze This , but it is a respectable sequel .;2
1682;1683;35709;Represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging Indian American cinema .;3
1266;1267;27571;The unexplored story opportunities of `` Punch-Drunk Love '' may have worked against the maker 's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer\/director Anderson .;3
1506;1507;32168;One of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while ...;4
2030;2031;42183;A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .;2
1136;1137;24943;Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means .;3
1832;1833;38468;If you 're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you 're at the right film .;3
1710;1711;36193;I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .;1
1191;1192;26052;The heat of the moment prevails .;3
1689;1690;35819;No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .;1
1902;1903;39815;More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .;1
1445;1446;31028;Entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately ... dare I say , entertaining !;4
1573;1574;33555;An overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort .;3
1750;1751;36945;Directed with purpose and finesse by England 's Roger Mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as Notting Hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft .;4
1698;1699;35981;The most brilliant and brutal UK crime film since Jack Carter went back to Newcastle , the first half of Gangster No. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .;4
1965;1966;41003;It 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by Kwan 's unique directing style .;4
1437;1438;30893;Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .;1

1552;1553;33119;All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .;2
1636;1637;34790;An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship .;4
1481;1482;31626;But it does somehow manage to get you under its spell .;3
1870;1871;39203;Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .;0
1196;1197;26111;If you have n't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in Spielberg 's work .;3
1628;1629;34665;A brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel .;4
1205;1206;26332;The cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .;3
1131;1132;24812;Light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .;4
1258;1259;27410;About a Boy vividly recalls the Cary Grant of Room for One More , Houseboat and Father Goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him .;2
1723;1724;36435;Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .;1
1741;1742;36747;As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .;0
1865;1866;39087;The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .;0

1345;1346;29059;Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .;1

1969;1970;41087;The search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because Blanchett and Ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering .;4
1661;1662;35337;It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .;0
1761;1762;37149;... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . '';1
1197;1198;26133;Me no lika da accents so good , but I thoroughly enjoyed the love story .;3
1956;1957;40847;Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .;1
1997;1998;41508;Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .;1
1553;1554;33151;`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors;3

1406;1407;30291;Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .;4

2097;2098;43384;Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .;1
1423;1424;30624;I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .;1

1113;1114;24482;Not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .;4

1698;1699;35981;The most brilliant and brutal UK crime film since Jack Carter went back to Newcastle , the first half of Gangster No. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .;4
1846;1847;38749;O.K. , not really .;2
1424;1425;30637;All in all , Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .;3

2048;2049;42495;Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they ca n't go wrong .;4
1744;1745;36834;Like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen 's astringent wit .;3
1849;1850;38785;A tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .;3
1162;1163;25404;The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .;0

1850;1851;38794;The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .;2

1523;1524;32527;It does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .;3
1996;1997;41501;A lot smarter than your average Bond .;3
1189;1190;25999;The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .;0
1818;1819;38230;You just know something terrible is going to happen .;2
1119;1120;24586;Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .;1

1797;1798;37798;Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters .;3
1466;1467;31369;It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .;0

1086;1087;23923;Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .;2

1323;1324;28618;Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , The Four Feathers comes up short .;0
1093;1094;24059;Despite its Hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of `` Lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage Shirley Temple script .;1
1435;1436;30847;The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .;4
1650;1651;35117;The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time .;3
1572;1573;33527;Vividly demonstrates that the director of such Hollywood blockbusters as Patriot Games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop .;4
1343;1344;29011;By surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , Haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way .;3
1409;1410;30361;Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .;3

1569;1570;33478;A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .;0

1600;1601;34071;On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .;2
1713;1714;36259;Give Shapiro , Goldman , and Bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .;1
1633;1634;34733;The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` Baran . ';4

1562;1563;33354;And thanks to Kline 's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable .;4
2129;2130;43936;The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .;4

1542;1543;32937;The main problem being that it 's only a peek .;2
1974;1975;41197;For a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them .;3

1588;1589;33799;Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .;2

1181;1182;25817;But here 's a movie about it anyway .;1
2077;2078;43046;To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .;1

1260;1261;27457;The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .;0
2069;2070;42845;I 've never bought from telemarketers , but I bought this movie .;3
1524;1525;32540;Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .;2
1419;1420;30559;Nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil .;4
1236;1237;26940;A seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by Georgian-Israeli director Dover Kosashvili .;3
2029;2030;42176;A wordy wisp of a comedy .;2
2022;2023;42027;Those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to Ichi .;3
1680;1681;35684;Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .;1
1730;1731;36586;I had more fun watching Spy than I had with most of the big summer movies .;4
1094;1095;24100;Reassuring , retro uplifter .;4
1286;1287;28017;Though filmed partly in Canada , Paid in Full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the Reagan years .;3
1841;1842;38646;The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .;2
1177;1178;25762;Amazing !;4
1316;1317;28468;The film truly does rescue -LRB- the Funk Brothers -RRB- from Motown 's shadows .;2
1734;1735;36641;You can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards .;3
1557;1558;33248;Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .;2
1504;1505;32127;A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .;1
1382;1383;29820;A stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world 's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making .;4
1257;1258;27381;You might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` Simone , '' and consider a DVD rental instead .;1
1219;1220;26602;This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .;0
1224;1225;26708;... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .;1
2122;2123;43787;The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .;1
1375;1376;29706;Go , girls , right down the reality drain .;1
1226;1227;26750;Compellingly watchable .;4
1672;1673;35521;This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .;2
1256;1257;27357;Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .;2
1185;1186;25884;-LRB- Kirshner wins , but it 's close . -RRB-;2
1905;1906;39887;The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .;1
1855;1856;38914;Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .;0
1200;1201;26204;hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .;1
2104;2105;43525;Great dragons !;3
1401;1402;30201;An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .;1
1754;1755;37046;Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .;2
1732;1733;36605;the shackles;2
1514;1515;32307;-LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .;1
1501;1502;32079;Qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere .;2
1337;1338;28845;It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .;3
1312;1313;28397;What a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is .;3
1512;1513;32257;Deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .;4
1753;1754;37025;Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .;1
1677;1678;35599;It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .;4
1173;1174;25701;One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .;4
2042;2043;42381;Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .;2
1640;1641;34865;Although mainstream American movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel .;3
1625;1626;34584;Quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and Moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between Jane Wyman and June Cleaver .;3
1092;1093;24052;You can thank me for this .;2
1536;1537;32801;Many of Benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice .;2
1758;1759;37106;It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .;0
1944;1945;40621;As Antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion .;3
1857;1858;38950;Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .;0
1313;1314;28408;Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .;2
1260;1261;27457;The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .;0
1714;1715;36285;"... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .";0
1374;1375;29681;Does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of Richard Nixon .;2
1745;1746;36856;A taut , sobering film .;4
1365;1366;29482;Williams absolutely nails Sy 's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness .;3
1918;1919;40056;For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .;1
1101;1102;24230;Lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects;2
1678;1679;35647;Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .;2
1149;1150;25153;This filmed Tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it 's filmed Tosca that you want .;3
1542;1543;32937;The main problem being that it 's only a peek .;2
1270;1271;27678;Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up .;4
1151;1152;25183;Would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial New Yorker if 26-year-old Reese Witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , Melanie Carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned Hollywood magic .;3
1783;1784;37525;"As an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , Derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable .";3
1921;1922;40110;Less about Shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw Quentin Tarantino 's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .;2
1150;1151;25176;Lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless .;2
1940;1941;40553;A thriller without a lot of thrills .;0
1184;1185;25869;A live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .;4
1363;1364;29426;The sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in IMAX dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins .;3
1887;1888;39550;Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .;1
1229;1230;26808;The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his .;1
1421;1422;30606;With lesser talents , High Crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable .;2
1524;1525;32540;Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .;2
2027;2028;42138;Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .;1
1226;1227;26750;Compellingly watchable .;4
2056;2057;42649;He seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .;1
2128;2129;43921;... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .;1
1979;1980;41270;An enjoyable above average summer diversion .;3
1870;1871;39203;Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .;0
1775;1776;37399;Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .;3
2016;2017;41923;... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .;0
1067;1068;23573;A loquacious and dreary piece of business .;1
1907;1908;39918;... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .;0
1370;1371;29582;An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .;0
1258;1259;27410;About a Boy vividly recalls the Cary Grant of Room for One More , Houseboat and Father Goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him .;2
1949;1950;40682;In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .;2
1947;1948;40660;Real Women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way .;4
1330;1331;28722;A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .;0
1818;1819;38230;You just know something terrible is going to happen .;2
1106;1107;24344;the film belongs to the marvelous Verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public;3
1683;1684;35728;A compelling film .;4
1297;1298;28211;-LRB- A -RRB- real pleasure in its laid-back way .;4

1932;1933;40400;The Bourne Identity should n't be half as entertaining as it is , but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood .;3
1852;1853;38843;Even kids deserve better .;1
1469;1470;31418;If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .;0
1556;1557;33224;A funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage `` be careful what you wish for '' is given a full workout .;4
1199;1200;26196;A timid , soggy near miss .;1
1779;1780;37484;Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .;0
1221;1222;26637;Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .;2
1408;1409;30340;But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .;0
1919;1920;40098;A true-blue delight .;4
1962;1963;40942;A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .;1
1692;1693;35857;` Christian Bale 's Quinn -LRB- is -RRB- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . ';1

2005;2006;41684;Empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .;1

1893;1894;39666;De Ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .;2
1559;1560;33293;So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .;0
