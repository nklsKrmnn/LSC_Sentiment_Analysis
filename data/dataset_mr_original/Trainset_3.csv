2337;2338;47932;Beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart .;3
2216;2217;45615;Has its moments , but it 's pretty far from a treasure .;2
2552;2553;51757;Despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film .;4
2683;2685;54036;The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .;0
2909;2912;57791;It 's up to -LRB- Watts -RRB- to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe .;3

2569;2570;52059;Predictably soulless techno-tripe .;0
3098;3101;61351;The entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what 's available is lovely and lovable .;2
3016;3019;59852;is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .;1

2241;2242;46109;There 's already been too many of these films ...;0
3040;3043;60255;But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .;0
2411;2412;49292;Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...;1
2943;2946;58459;The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .;2
2490;2491;50658;"The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .";2
2898;2901;57507;Yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness .;3

2273;2274;46723;Delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity .;3
2516;2517;51137;The limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie .;2
2786;2789;55756;`` What John does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .;2

2540;2541;51565;A sensitive and astute first feature by Anne-Sophie Birot .;3

2822;2825;56345;This is a film living far too much in its own head .;1
2424;2425;49531;Neatly constructed thriller .;3
2999;3002;59528;Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .;1
2788;2791;55796;A graceful , moving tribute to the courage of New York 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice .;4
2250;2251;46255;Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .;1

2616;2617;52805;If you 're paying attention , the `` big twists '' are pretty easy to guess - but that does n't make the movie any less entertaining .;2

3100;3103;61391;Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .;1
2666;2668;53731;This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it .;4
2792;2795;55911;As it stands it 's an opera movie for the buffs .;2
2804;2807;56084;This is not an easy film .;1
2508;2509;50963;Feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class .;2
3075;3078;60943;This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .;1

2610;2611;52721;If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well .;4
2912;2915;57849;Diggs and Lathan are among the chief reasons Brown Sugar is such a sweet and sexy film .;4
2815;2818;56221;There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .;1
2210;2211;45473;Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .;0
3025;3028;59995;What -LRB- Denis -RRB- accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned .;3
3117;3120;61723;The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .;0
2379;2380;48722;Conforms itself with creating a game of ` who 's who ' ... where the characters ' moves are often more predictable than their consequences .;1
2511;2512;51030;S1M0NE 's satire is not subtle , but it is effective .;3
3129;3132;61927;There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .;0

3075;3078;60943;This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .;1
3169;3172;62721;A bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that French realism .;3
2871;2874;57069;A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .;1
2784;2787;55709;What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .;0
2848;2851;56721;PC stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .;1
2340;2341;47994;More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .;1
2937;2940;58313;There 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of Monsoon Wedding in Late Marriage -- and that 's part of what makes Dover Kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent .;4

2916;2919;57900;A sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity .;3
2918;2921;57957;More than their unique residences , Home Movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .;4
2718;2720;54653;A solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration .;3
2861;2864;56921;There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .;1

2202;2203;45286;... creates a visceral sense of its characters ' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above ... what could have been a melodramatic , Lifetime Channel-style anthology .;2
2174;2175;44818;Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .;2
2236;2237;45994;In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .;1
3011;3014;59768;There is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care .;4
2488;2489;50598;A fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries .;4
2201;2202;45263;The film sometimes flags ... but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace .;2
2492;2493;50681;Like Edward Norton in American History X , Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder By Numbers -RRB- delivers a magnetic performance .;4
2534;2535;51476;` Synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .;1

2446;2447;49880;The Master of Disguise is awful .;0
3143;3146;62226;We have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting .;2

2780;2783;55662;Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .;0
2940;2943;58389;A time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain .;4
3105;3108;61480;Here 's my advice , Kev .;2
2800;2803;56043;Overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very Imaxy .;2
2883;2886;57277;Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .;1
3049;3052;60426;The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .;1
3062;3065;60665;more precious than perspicacious;3

2519;2520;51191;Art-house to the core , Read My Lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old French cinema .;3
3119;3122;61762;... with the gifted Pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled Machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself .;4
2725;2727;54773;Many insightful moments .;3
3151;3154;62390;What makes the movie work -- to an admittedly limited extent -- is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers .;2
2618;2619;52841;Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .;3
2648;2650;53438;A plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of ` home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households .;3
2734;2736;54930;Does n't really add up to much .;1
2203;2204;45317;To honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to American workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed .;1
2566;2567;52027;A respectable but uninspired thriller that 's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact .;2
2560;2561;51900;Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .;1
2441;2442;49800;Indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions .;3
2668;2670;53776;But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .;0
3131;3134;61963;It 's like an all-star salute to Disney 's cheesy commercialism .;1
2874;2877;57116;Take Care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length .;1
2360;2361;48360;Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .;1
2542;2543;51589;A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .;1
2339;2340;47968;While the now 72-year-old Robert Evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own .;3
3020;3023;59888;Despite a performance of sustained intelligence from Stanford and another of subtle humour from Bebe Neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces Oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich New York intelligentsia - and its off;2
2990;2993;59338;Ice Age wo n't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and I 'm giving it a strong thumbs up .;3

2814;2817;56210;Samuel Beckett applied to the Iranian voting process .;2
2147;2148;44287;The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .;3
2381;2382;48782;Sure , I hated myself in the morning .;1
2471;2472;50271;A glorious mess .;2
2186;2187;45040;Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .;2

2271;2272;46670;The director , Mark Pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head .;3
2751;2754;55237;Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .;1
2580;2581;52244;The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .;0
2750;2753;55229;Killing time , that 's all that 's going on here .;0
2802;2805;56065;The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .;1
2289;2290;46999;A truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation .;4
2941;2944;58424;I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .;0
2877;2880;57172;With lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- Max is static , stilted .;2
2612;2613;52753;No , it 's not as single-minded as John Carpenter 's original , but it 's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels .;3
2435;2436;49668;There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .;1
2193;2194;45163;Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .;1
2739;2741;55014;Let 's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate .;3
3099;3102;61366;It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .;0

3013;3016;59798;My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .;1
2625;2626;52978;But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .;0

2810;2813;56147;Jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used .;2
2672;2674;53865;A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .;0
2208;2209;45455;A comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life .;3

2369;2370;48496;Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .;1
2545;2546;51647;Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .;1
3115;3118;61706;The script ?;1
2411;2412;49292;Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...;1
2419;2420;49452;That 's fun for kids of any age .;4
3164;3167;62604;It 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can .;3
2642;2644;53268;A low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord .;3
2819;2822;56282;A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling .;4
2905;2908;57689;He 's worked too hard on this movie .;2
2550;2551;51730;One thing is for sure : This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou .;2
3123;3126;61835;The movie is our story as much as it is Schmidt 's , no matter if it 's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale .;2
3170;3173;62747;A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .;1
2771;2774;55546;Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?;0
3066;3069;60762;The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .;1

2387;2388;48895;As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .;0
3112;3115;61625;There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch .;4

2234;2235;45935;None of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting is n't , either , and you would n't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ?;3

2302;2303;47253;Starts slowly , but Adrien Brody -- in the title role -- helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying .;3
2672;2674;53865;A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .;0
3159;3162;62501;While the transgressive trappings -LRB- especially the frank sex scenes -RRB- ensure that the film is never dull , Rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .;1

2389;2390;48954;This film is so different from The Apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see Samira Makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .;3

2391;2392;49009;Terrible .;0

2635;2637;53156;It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny .;4
2869;2872;57038;The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .;3
2199;2200;45252;A flawed but engrossing thriller .;3
2988;2991;59286;The setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` Intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .;2
3009;3012;59733;The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .;0

2333;2334;47864;A visionary marvel , but it 's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this .;1

2713;2715;54592;The comedy makes social commentary more palatable .;2
2598;2599;52506;Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .;1
2300;2301;47213;There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .;0

3109;3112;61570;Arliss Howard 's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , Big Bad Love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws .;4
2803;2806;56081;Odd and weird .;1
2812;2815;56168;Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .;0

2807;2810;56103;A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .;1
2785;2788;55736;Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .;1

3081;3084;61024;Angela Gheorghiu as famous prima donna Floria Tosca , Roberto Alagna as her lover Mario Cavaradossi , and Ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief Scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately .;3
2187;2188;45062;Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?;1
2257;2258;46429;There 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but Kang tacks on three or four more endings .;2
2652;2654;53530;Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .;0
2971;2974;58966;Munch 's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters .;3
3003;3006;59603;Superb production values & Christian Bale 's charisma make up for a derivative plot .;3
3094;3097;61280;Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .;3
2787;2790;55792;... hypnotically dull .;0
2287;2288;46950;When not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .;1
2829;2832;56427;Dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch .;2
2164;2165;44662;For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .;1
2943;2946;58459;The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .;2
2793;2796;55923;Sex is one of those films that aims to confuse .;1
2951;2954;58620;A riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban Hades .;3
3033;3036;60180;Even more baffling is that it 's funny .;2
2323;2324;47682;There 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .;3
3120;3123;61797;Oh , James !;3
2218;2219;45647;Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .;0
3080;3083;61016;On that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint .;4
3175;3178;62801;The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .;0
2897;2900;57475;Sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to Frida Kahlo as if her life did , too .;2
2875;2878;57138;The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .;1
2251;2252;46283;A poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .;2
2645;2647;53348;Cho 's latest comic set is n't as sharp or as fresh as I 'm the One That I Want ... but it 's still damn funny stuff .;3
2973;2976;58998;There 's no energy .;0
2597;2598;52492;Despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances .;3
2380;2381;48745;A different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of World War II through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst .;3
2431;2432;49624;The first half bursts with a goofy energy previous Disney films only used for a few minutes here and there .;2
2825;2828;56401;Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .;0
3110;3113;61599;But , no , we get another scene , and then another .;2
3108;3111;61541;turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters;0

3186;3189;62993;"In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .";0
2236;2237;45994;In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .;1
2291;2292;47026;Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year .;4
2655;2657;53576;Morton deserves an Oscar nomination .;4
2590;2591;52384;Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .;0
2144;2145;44226;An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .;3
2583;2584;52275;Spend your Benjamins on a matinee .;2
3118;3121;61748;A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .;1
2315;2316;47499;The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .;1
3007;3010;59650;It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .;0
3008;3011;59699;Confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of Barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .;3
3173;3176;62784;Hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining .;4
2469;2470;50250;David Spade as Citizen Kane ?;1
2442;2443;49816;A grating , emaciated flick .;1
2964;2967;58846;is a mess .;0
2721;2723;54716;We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .;0
3106;3109;61486;Like all of Egoyan 's work , Ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious .;3
3085;3088;61117;Foster and Whitaker are especially fine .;4
2313;2314;47481;Mr. Deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy .;4
2882;2885;57254;Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .;0
2683;2685;54036;The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .;0
2412;2413;49305;Seeing Seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on Letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but .;2
2788;2791;55796;A graceful , moving tribute to the courage of New York 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice .;4
2727;2729;54807;It never is , not fully .;2
2537;2538;51525;The animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet Return to Neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .;2
3133;3136;62004;The path Ice Age follows most closely , though , is the one established by Warner Bros. giant Chuck Jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie 's release .;2
3141;3144;62178;-LRB- Fiji diver Rusi Vulakoro and the married couple Howard and Michelle Hall -RRB- show us the world they love and make us love it , too .;4

2915;2918;57885;But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .;2
2299;2300;47194;The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .;2
2986;2989;59222;... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .;0
2872;2875;57075;Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had .;0
2887;2890;57342;The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .;3

2178;2179;44923;The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock .;2
2335;2336;47899;Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .;0
2614;2615;52794;Blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances .;3
3195;3198;63237;A jaw-droppingly beautiful work;4
2991;2994;59360;Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .;0
2562;2563;51938;The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .;1
2856;2859;56857;I can easily imagine Benigni 's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial .;4
3138;3141;62115;The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .;1
3163;3166;62596;Marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary .;4
2267;2268;46597;Even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... you almost do n't notice the 129-minute running time .;4
2774;2777;55610;A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .;0
2657;2659;53590;Some episodes work , some do n't .;1

2282;2283;46862;If you 're not , you 'll still have a good time . '';3
2293;2294;47038;An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .;1
2312;2313;47463;The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .;4
3188;3191;63069;Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . ';1
2742;2744;55055;You come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated .;3
2460;2461;50098;A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .;1
3071;3074;60888;A compelling motion picture that illustrates an American tragedy .;4
2700;2702;54372;A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .;2
2285;2286;46906;Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .;1
2488;2489;50598;A fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries .;4
2693;2695;54238;An action\/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of Day of the Jackal , The French Connection , and Heat .;4
2268;2269;46623;In a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that Secret Ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .;3
2930;2933;58198;Moretti ... is the rare common-man artist who 's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness .;3
3194;3197;63211;An incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks .;3

2152;2153;44408;Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .;1
2443;2444;49823;Dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed .;2
3172;3175;62765;Beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it 's a lyrical endeavour .;4
2410;2411;49271;Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -LRB- or worth rooting against , for that matter -RRB- .;1

3096;3099;61310;The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .;1

2993;2996;59392;Imamura has said that Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women .;3
2165;2166;44675;Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants .;1
2227;2228;45814;A little objectivity could have gone a long way .;2
2824;2827;56386;An obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ?;1
2977;2980;59057;You do n't know whether to admire the film 's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace .;1
2638;2640;53196;Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .;1
3046;3049;60376;Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .;0

2198;2199;45244;A perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy .;3
2630;2632;53053;Good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there 's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat .;3
2830;2833;56433;Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .;1
3073;3076;60906;Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .;0
2894;2897;57439;From beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film .;2
2222;2223;45708;You can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored ... audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter .;4
2903;2906;57619;All right , so it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny -LRB- sometimes hilarious -RRB- comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast .;3
2307;2308;47331;A generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith .;4
3051;3054;60493;Steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic .;3
2757;2760;55338;The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .;1
2479;2480;50434;But it 's also disappointing to a certain degree .;1
2675;2677;53927;Martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more .;2
3175;3178;62801;The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .;0
2779;2782;55658;I do n't think so .;1
2588;2589;52354;The animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst .;4
2921;2924;58011;The film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by Christopher Plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil Uncle Ralph I 've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work .;4
2810;2813;56147;Jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used .;2
2784;2787;55709;What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .;0
3092;3095;61227;If villainous vampires are your cup of blood , Blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest .;3
2854;2857;56830;The movie is amateurish , but it 's a minor treat .;3
2864;2867;56979;Affable if not timeless , Like Mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids .;3
2246;2247;46165;... The movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .;1
