5403;5409;102677;- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .;0

5650;5656;107075;Part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .;4
6021;6029;113441;Excellent performances from Jacqueline Bisset and Martha Plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama .;4
5970;5978;112560;But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .;1

5842;5849;110419;The actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way .;4
5896;5903;111317;Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .;0
5803;5810;109645;Miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .;4
5486;5492;104146;An overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful French coming-of-age film ...;2
5614;5620;106403;There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .;1

5922;5930;111710;The camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm .;4
6232;6241;116990;In the real world;2
5785;5792;109357;The film 's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature\/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality .;1
5920;5928;111688;What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .;0
5627;5633;106655;You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?;2
5936;5944;111974;A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .;0
6178;6186;116047;Has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 're not interested .;3
5748;5755;108719;An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .;0
6331;6340;118629;A bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy .;3
5537;5543;104921;From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten;0
6046;6054;113882;Oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between .;0
5591;5597;105998;With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .;1
5450;5456;103443;Poignant and moving , A Walk to Remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter .;4
5505;5511;104438;Very stupid and annoying .;0
5713;5720;108114;No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .;2
6271;6280;117680;Ken Russell would love this .;3
5580;5586;105838;You could love Safe Conduct -LRB- Laissez Passer -RRB- for being a subtitled French movie that is 170 minutes long .;2
5704;5711;107957;A fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man .;3
5747;5754;108699;First and foremost ... the reason to go see `` Blue Crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by David Hennings .;4
6303;6312;118155;To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .;2
5942;5950;112074;So fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated .;3
6024;6032;113470;an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades;1
5451;5457;103461;While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .;1
5793;5800;109496;A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .;0
6342;6351;118824;"Most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; `` Frailty '' leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home .";3
6099;6107;114744;This is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but Ayres makes the right choices at every turn .;3
6071;6079;114292;The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .;1
5795;5802;109527;It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .;2
6017;6025;113394;The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .;4
5780;5787;109284;A riveting documentary .;4
5393;5399;102572;Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .;1
5969;5977;112531;A fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . ';4
5872;5879;110959;The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .;1
6221;6229;116788;A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .;3
5570;5576;105592;Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .;0
6016;6024;113361;This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .;0
5710;5717;108056;A witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking .;2
6020;6028;113426;A fanciful drama about Napoleon 's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility .;4
5894;5901;111290;Far away .;2
5552;5558;105257;While not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging .;2
6222;6230;116798;It 's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .;4
5991;5999;112954;Devotees of Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best Next Generation episodes is lacking .;1
5976;5984;112697;Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . '';1
5604;5610;106241;By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .;3
6038;6046;113756;Its director 's most substantial feature for some time .;3
5556;5562;105323;An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .;1
5532;5538;104859;There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .;0
5581;5587;105859;Salma goes native and she 's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a Mexican icon .;4
5384;5390;102410;That the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor .;1
5399;5405;102627;A compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one .;3
6106;6114;114837;What 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor .;1
6338;6347;118730;Talk to Her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching .;3
6167;6175;115858;The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .;0
6319;6328;118434;That rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .;3
5376;5382;102265;Much of this slick and sprightly CGI feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings .;3
5576;5582;105729;Schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film 's present with the playful paranoia of the film 's past . ';4
6364;6374;119243;While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .;2
5889;5896;111206;The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .;1
5905;5912;111425;You really have to salute writer-director Haneke -LRB- he adapted Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- for making a film that is n't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch .;2
5774;5781;109162;Though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , Ozpetek falls short in showing us Antonia 's true emotions ... But at the very least , His Secret Life will leave you thinking .;3
5526;5532;104748;Parker can not sustain the buoyant energy level of the film 's city beginnings into its country conclusion ';1
6192;6200;116290;Not even Solondz 's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .;1
5731;5738;108435;Woody Allen has really found his groove these days .;4
5928;5936;111838;It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .;2

5547;5553;105121;What ` Dumb and Dumber ' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script .;2
6166;6174;115851;A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .;0
6207;6215;116548;Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression .;2
6291;6300;117932;Though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there 's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting .;3
5480;5486;104023;Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .;0
6272;6281;117686;Thumbs down .;0
5833;5840;110280;It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .;0
5822;5829;110056;Each of these stories has the potential for Touched by an Angel simplicity and sappiness , but Thirteen Conversations About One Thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .;4
6044;6052;113844;Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother Hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense .;1

5990;5998;112925;... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that I ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .;0
5679;5685;107571;Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .;0
5852;5859;110551;An uplifting , near-masterpiece .;4
6367;6377;119305;It 's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it 's implosion rather than explosion you fear .;2
5719;5726;108220;My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...;0
5973;5981;112638;The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .;0
5638;5644;106872;Often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .;1
5819;5826;109994;It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .;2
6281;6290;117793;Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .;1

5484;5490;104116;Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .;1
5777;5784;109220;Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .;1
6283;6292;117814;Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .;0
5971;5979;112573;` The film is stark , straightforward and deadly ... an unnatural calm that 's occasionally shaken by ... blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . ';2
6141;6149;115388;As the movie traces Mr. Brown 's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .;4
6376;6386;119419;Quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year ... a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that is n't afraid to admit it does n't have all the answers .;3
6162;6170;115779;Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .;1
5644;5650;107007;The entire cast is first-rate , especially Sorvino .;4
6307;6316;118241;It 's sweet .;3

5903;5910;111411;Unwieldy contraption .;1
5866;5873;110834;It 's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor .;4
5450;5456;103443;Poignant and moving , A Walk to Remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter .;4
5587;5593;105941;A sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .;1
5448;5454;103428;One of the greatest films I 've ever seen .;4
6335;6344;118681;It 's a hoot watching The Rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire !;4
5411;5417;102790;Here is a divine monument to a single man 's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music .;4
6001;6009;113131;I have two words to say about Reign of Fire .;2
5540;5546;104980;Instead of trying to bust some blondes , -LRB- Diggs -RRB- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .;1
5563;5569;105447;This dubious product of a college-spawned -LRB- Colgate U. -RRB- comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .;1
5438;5444;103217;You can almost see Mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` This is going to be something really good . ';3
6163;6171;115813;I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws Igby Goes Down may possess , it is undeniably that .;3
6015;6023;113331;If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat .;3
6239;6248;117089;Few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as Nesbitt 's Cooper looks when the bullets stop flying .;3
5513;5519;104541;Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality;2
5788;5795;109419;This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .;1
6255;6264;117394;Raimi and his team could n't have done any better in bringing the story of Spider-Man to the big screen .;4
6216;6224;116702;The most remarkable -LRB- and frustrating -RRB- thing about World Traveler , which opens today in Manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank .;2
5862;5869;110785;The quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by Rachel Griffiths .;4
5415;5421;102863;A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .;2
5432;5438;103116;Vulgar is too optimistic a title .;0
6003;6011;113151;A first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you .;4
6088;6096;114569;The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .;1
6000;6008;113114;One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .;1
5829;5836;110200;To some eyes;2
5611;5617;106370;An almost unbearably morbid love story .;0
5712;5719;108077;A thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it does n't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world .;3
6196;6204;116355;It 's a masterpiece .;4
5457;5463;103575;I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .;3
6220;6228;116771;It 's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes .;2
5426;5432;103056;It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .;2
5820;5827;110027;It 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on .;3
5528;5534;104806;Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .;0
6250;6259;117303;Not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece .;4
5992;6000;112985;Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , Vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .;1
5539;5545;104969;Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .;2
6329;6338;118595;It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .;2
6297;6306;118038;Passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .;3
5943;5951;112099;Like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive .;2
6286;6295;117870;Not the best Herzog perhaps , but unmistakably Herzog .;2
5967;5975;112494;Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?;1
5531;5537;104832;With amazing finesse , the film shadows Heidi 's trip back to Vietnam and the city where her mother , Mai Thi Kim , still lives .;3
5398;5404;102620;One of the most incoherent features in recent memory .;0
5908;5915;111484;It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .;1
5508;5514;104478;In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .;0
5956;5964;112301;The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .;2

6126;6134;115150;The animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of Pokemon 4 Ever is any indication .;0
6151;6159;115566;Spy Kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : It actually improves upon the original hit movie .;4
5962;5970;112399;K-19 : The Widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining .;3
6241;6250;117140;An unflinching , complex portrait of a modern Israel that is rarely seen on-screen .;3
5522;5528;104677;With Freeman and Judd , I 'll at least remember their characters .;2
6193;6201;116309;Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .;1
6123;6131;115081;Coppola 's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema .;3
5476;5482;103944;An enthralling aesthetic experience , one that 's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty .;4
5733;5740;108466;A coming-of-age tale from New Zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board .;3
5657;5663;107163;The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .;2
5882;5889;111111;Henry Bean 's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect;3
5570;5576;105592;Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .;0
5676;5682;107519;Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .;1
5477;5483;103964;Berling and;2
6146;6154;115505;A solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .;3
6129;6137;115229;The movie is without intent .;1
6153;6161;115603;Maggie G. makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen .;4
5441;5447;103288;Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff .;4
6014;6022;113314;The success of Undercover Brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally .;3

5906;5913;111460;In his latest effort , Storytelling , Solondz has finally made a movie that is n't just offensive -- it also happens to be good .;3
6303;6312;118155;To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .;2
5501;5507;104375;Delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for .;3
5776;5783;109215;This is just lazy writing .;0

6118;6126;115008;Sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .;4
6219;6227;116761;Cube 's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche .;2
5395;5401;102591;The only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .;0
5767;5774;109036;A movie you observe , rather than one you enter into .;1
6005;6013;113200;It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .;0
6381;6391;119554;A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .;4
6052;6060;113988;Few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director Neil Burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering Barry 's terrific performance .;2

5710;5717;108056;A witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking .;2
5913;5921;111589;Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative .;4
5740;5747;108593;Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .;2
5796;5803;109539;... unbearably lame .;0
5617;5623;106463;Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .;1
5624;5630;106605;Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .;1
5469;5475;103848;A fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to Betty Fisher and left out the other stories .;2
5546;5552;105100;Between them , De Niro and Murphy make Showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season .;4
6202;6210;116448;As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .;1
5822;5829;110056;Each of these stories has the potential for Touched by an Angel simplicity and sappiness , but Thirteen Conversations About One Thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .;4

6226;6235;116860;The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .;2
6107;6115;114849;Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?;2
6118;6126;115008;Sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .;4

5877;5884;111034;Simply put , `` Far From Heaven '' is a masterpiece .;4
5830;5837;110207;Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .;0
5571;5577;105622;Greengrass -LRB- working from Don Mullan 's script -RRB- forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in Northern Ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .;2

5797;5804;109542;Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders .;1
5341;5347;101598;A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .;1
5385;5391;102428;Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .;1

5607;5613;106310;Everyone 's insecure in Lovely and Amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .;4
5804;5811;109670;Less than fresh .;1

5825;5832;110132;I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .;1
6098;6106;114731;A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .;2

5430;5436;103094;A slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time .;4
5778;5785;109238;Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .;0

6223;6232;116807;It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and The Laramie Project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in America .;4

5343;5349;101626;With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .;1
5397;5403;102612;This franchise has not spawned a single good film .;0
5899;5906;111364;The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .;0
6047;6055;113892;Forget the Psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo n't seem like such a bore .;1
5543;5549;105032;Director Todd Solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates .;3
6204;6212;116508;Just how these families interact may surprise you .;2
5846;5853;110481;When a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there 's something there .;4
5613;5619;106397;A pleasing , often-funny comedy .;3
6027;6035;113503;I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .;0
5630;5636;106719;A realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales .;3

5779;5786;109271;The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .;0
5735;5742;108495;... less a story than an inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population 's shrugging acceptance to each new horror .;1
5978;5986;112720;A funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a British cast to rival Gosford Park 's .;4
5459;5465;103615;It will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .;3
6119;6127;115025;As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .;0
5565;5571;105500;The climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does;2
5695;5702;107821;Do n't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .;2
6267;6276;117611;A completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .;3
5588;5594;105956;Passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly ...;3
5848;5855;110502;A dashing and absorbing outing with one of France 's most inventive directors .;3
5723;5730;108282;A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .;0
6381;6391;119554;A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .;4
6243;6252;117174;Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .;1
5461;5467;103652;While it can be a bit repetitive , overall it 's an entertaining and informative documentary .;3

6285;6294;117856;A heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers ' hearts .;4
5436;5442;103173;Left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of Charlotte 's web of desire and desperation .;3
5857;5864;110641;Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .;1
5434;5440;103145;A refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale .;4
5485;5491;104126;Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .;1
5650;5656;107075;Part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .;4
5351;5357;101753;This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .;0
5793;5800;109496;A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .;0
5834;5841;110292;That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .;0
6083;6091;114504;The story ultimately takes hold and grips hard .;4
5794;5801;109513;Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .;2
6346;6355;118912;A feeble Tootsie knockoff .;1
6054;6062;114018;How I Killed My Father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .;2
5632;5638;106744;The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .;0
6242;6251;117153;Efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug .;3
5336;5342;101559;A deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams .;4
6154;6162;115618;Very well-written and very well-acted .;4
6225;6234;116844;It is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad .;3
6300;6309;118109;The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding .;2
5890;5897;111216;An entertaining British hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance .;4
5739;5746;108555;Skin Of Man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults .;3
5909;5917;111508;It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .;2
5795;5802;109527;It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .;2

5621;5627;106557;Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .;0
5854;5861;110569;A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . ';0
5449;5455;103434;By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .;1
5645;5651;107013;Walter Hill 's Undisputed is like a 1940s Warner Bros. .;3
6359;6369;119154;The film gets close to the chimps the same way Goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection .;3
5653;5659;107105;This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .;0
6387;6397;119625;Has its share of arresting images .;2
6077;6085;114415;A genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama .;4
5969;5977;112531;A fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . ';4
6175;6183;115996;Suffice to say that after seeing this movie in IMAX form , you 'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of Tom Hanks ' face than his wife is .;2
5870;5877;110898;It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective .;2
6057;6065;114068;While certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , Jeong-Hyang Lee 's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .;2
