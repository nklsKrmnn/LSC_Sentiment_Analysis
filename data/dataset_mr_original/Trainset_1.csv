30;31;840;Nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .;2
533;534;12449;It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .;2
950;951;21247;With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .;1

895;896;20140;Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .;0
276;277;6930;The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .;0
475;476;11109;More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .;1

542;543;12626;What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .;3

599;600;13931;The early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us .;4
141;142;3732;-LRB- Cho 's face is -RRB- an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots .;3
565;566;13166;This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .;3
626;627;14563;It 's just rather leaden and dull .;0
123;124;3273;It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison .;2
668;669;15616;So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .;0
323;324;7953;A dreadful day in Irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment .;3
759;760;17528;From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .;4
493;494;11470;A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad .;2
495;496;11496;Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .;1
269;270;6738;Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .;4
419;420;9996;plays like some corny television production from a bygone era;1
812;813;18531;An ambitious and moving but bleak film .;2
439;440;10450;Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .;1
454;455;10723;Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements .;2
704;705;16376;Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . '';3
189;190;4885;The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .;0
584;585;13639;Rather than real figures;1
328;329;8028;A relative letdown .;0
1015;1016;22473;Well , they 're ` they ' .;2
57;58;1539;Mark Pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .;3
614;615;14277;Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .;1
644;645;14990;... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .;4
490;491;11429;This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .;0
775;776;17867;Upper Teens may get cynical .;1
94;95;2473;Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .;0
878;879;19873;A fifty car pileup of cliches .;0
189;190;4885;The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .;0
338;339;8191;Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .;1
112;113;2972;The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .;0
604;605;14061;Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .;0
515;516;12005;So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride .;3
122;123;3265;Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .;1
136;137;3643;Intriguing and downright intoxicating .;4
358;359;8645;Not as good as the original , but what is ...;2
234;235;5877;Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents;0
93;94;2453;Writer\/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .;3
243;244;6112;Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .;2
433;434;10319;Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .;2
653;654;15204;You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .;3
977;978;21840;The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .;4
432;433;10284;A serviceable Euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , BMWs and seaside chateaus .;2
620;621;14413;It challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should .;3
61;62;1659;But arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us .;3
34;35;945;Cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , The Full Monty , with something different .;2
268;269;6708;Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods .;4
663;664;15491;With an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera;3
861;862;19614;It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .;1
145;146;3824;Like the world of his film , Hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .;1
544;545;12666;Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time;2
835;836;19054;Not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season .;4
52;53;1446;Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .;0
976;977;21811;It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .;2
718;719;16650;None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...;1
569;570;13233;Nair and writer Laura Cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .;2
708;709;16476;Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .;4
1024;1025;22643;It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .;1
77;78;2034;Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .;2
121;122;3263;Absorbing character;2
201;202;5131;But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .;1
793;794;18202;Thin period piece .;2
156;157;4164;Has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke .;3
517;518;12075;I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .;0
147;148;3890;Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .;1
745;746;17176;The large-frame IMAX camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .;4
978;979;21883;... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .;1
497;498;11570;She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit .;3
465;466;10922;Gets better after Foster leaves that little room .;3
364;365;8745;The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .;0
108;109;2841;Filmmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power .;4
142;143;3760;It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .;1
418;419;9982;Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .;0
44;45;1216;Fortunately , you still have that option .;2
930;931;20859;Swimming is above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds .;4
437;438;10411;It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .;4
623;624;14469;Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .;3
847;848;19303;Maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts .;3
1032;1033;22835;Eh .;2
909;910;20363;This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .;4
821;822;18730;Metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story .;3
188;189;4878;The result might look like Vulgar .;2
991;992;22116;The film exudes the urbane sweetness that Woody Allen seems to have bitterly forsaken .;3
603;604;14036;A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences .;0
804;805;18395;White has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .;1
711;712;16549;You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .;0
1016;1017;22480;Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .;1
1038;1039;22978;The modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases;4
54;55;1506;Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is .;4
396;397;9528;Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .;0
546;547;12699;Schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness .;1
840;841;19174;Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .;4
669;670;15628;Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there;2
161;162;4252;It 's the filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion .;3
506;507;11754;But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .;0
280;281;7014;A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . ';0
249;250;6282;Black-and-white and unrealistic .;0
690;691;16062;A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .;2
86;87;2274;Highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting .;4
71;72;1938;-LRB- Scherfig -RRB- has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters ' lives after the clever credits roll .;3
855;856;19496;There 's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes , plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme .;0
286;287;7102;-LRB- A -RRB- rather thinly-conceived movie .;0
996;997;22217;There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .;0
272;273;6795;It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .;1
412;413;9879;Bearable .;2
210;211;5318;Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as -LRB- Jason Bourne -RRB- .;3
448;449;10614;Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .;0
144;145;3800;It lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho .;3
245;246;6180;This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .;4
556;557;12955;Make Chan 's action sequences boring .;1
826;827;18837;Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .;1
431;432;10276;Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell ?;2
461;462;10864;A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .;1
1055;1056;23292;... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels .;4
460;461;10853;In some ways , Lagaan is quintessential Bollywood .;2
422;423;10051;Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .;1
1049;1050;23173;Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .;0
805;806;18416;... one resurrection too many .;1
288;289;7123;Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .;4
341;342;8239;With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .;2
512;513;11966;A processed comedy chop suey .;1
315;316;7774;Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts .;2
1056;1057;23317;It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .;3
402;403;9651;Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -;3
882;883;19911;You end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .;2
645;646;15013;A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .;4
1021;1022;22603;As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .;2
996;997;22217;There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .;0
171;172;4539;It 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects .;3
399;400;9598;Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .;3
875;876;19830;The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .;1
547;548;12722;After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .;0
819;820;18697;Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary .;2
474;475;11104;An extremely unpleasant film .;0
719;720;16662;Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .;1
1054;1055;23278;Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .;0
13;14;364;Fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense .;3
601;602;13972;A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .;2
659;660;15412;Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .;0
248;249;6254;It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .;3
543;544;12650;The film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .;4
425;426;10133;Though writer\/director Bart Freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of Crudup 's anchoring performance .;3
738;739;17026;In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .;1
79;80;2087;An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud .;4
796;797;18236;... the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with Musset unfolds as Sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form .;3
174;175;4595;... the one thing this Wild film has that other Imax films do n't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house .;2
723;724;16757;Really is a pan-American movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart .;3
496;497;11524;Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .;4
471;472;11061;Definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . ';3
411;412;9857;Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .;0
183;184;4813;The film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once .;3
848;849;19320;From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge ';3
258;259;6507;The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .;4
274;275;6847;Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .;1
981;982;21938;` Rare Birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .;2
337;338;8169;One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .;0
712;713;16561;Ferrara 's best film in years .;4
995;996;22208;I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .;0
929;930;20824;When you think you 've figured out Bielinsky 's great game , that 's when you 're in the most trouble : He 's the con , and you 're just the mark .;2
1055;1056;23292;... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels .;4
173;174;4585;Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .;2
298;299;7323;A dreary movie .;0
279;280;6981;In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .;0
852;853;19449;Affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with Spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together .;3
886;887;19998;A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .;2
784;785;18009;"It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .";0
583;584;13608;And there 's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after Greene 's story ends .;3
576;577;13398;We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .;0
434;435;10345;It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .;4
253;254;6391;Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .;1
964;965;21558;But ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters .;1
255;256;6449;A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .;3
105;106;2739;A macabre and very stylized Swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .;3
16;17;459;a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it;3
881;882;19905;Charlotte Sometimes is a brilliant movie .;4
680;681;15857;It 's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffith made in the early days of silent film .;4
372;373;8939;Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .;2
640;641;14908;or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? '';0
779;780;17918;feeling to it , but like the 1920 's , the trip there is a great deal of fun .;3
567;568;13209;It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .;3
180;181;4729;The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .;1
328;329;8028;A relative letdown .;0
298;299;7323;A dreary movie .;0
504;505;11698;It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .;3
496;497;11524;Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .;4
260;261;6557;A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .;2
115;116;3087;But when it does , you 're entirely unprepared .;2
570;571;13280;Goofy , nutty , consistently funny .;4
306;307;7555;A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .;1
498;499;11584;Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed .;3
631;632;14655;From the opening strains of the Average White Band 's `` Pick up the Pieces '' , you can feel the love .;3
1059;1060;23392;Its sheer dynamism is infectious .;3
726;727;16812;Crikey indeed .;2
1054;1055;23278;Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .;0
659;660;15412;Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .;0
577;578;13434;Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .;4
566;567;13190;A thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you can not separate them .;3
514;515;11985;Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .;1
296;297;7269;While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .;4
809;810;18459;-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-America diversions could ever be .;3
347;348;8367;I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .;1
755;756;17417;While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .;3
920;921;20633;The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .;1
452;453;10683;A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .;1
797;798;18269;More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .;0
480;481;11171;This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .;1
391;392;9416;Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .;3
371;372;8906;`` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .;4
53;54;1480;Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .;0
96;97;2520;`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .;0
769;770;17754;A generic international version of a typical American horror film .;1

382;383;9168;This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .;0
362;363;8705;Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .;0
262;263;6602;Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .;4

149;150;3961;It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .;1

436;437;10371;Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .;1
