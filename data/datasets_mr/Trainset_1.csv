906;907;20310;Somehow Ms. Griffiths and Mr. Pryce bring off this wild Welsh whimsy .;1
1031;1032;22785;The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react .;1
373;374;8956;An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .;1
1059;1060;23392;Its sheer dynamism is infectious .;1
861;862;19614;It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .;-1
80;81;2102;All in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own .;1
795;796;18210;The stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt .;0
412;413;9879;Bearable .;0
232;233;5827;With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .;-1
645;646;15013;A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .;1
921;922;20653;So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .;-1
364;365;8745;The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .;-1
950;951;21247;With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .;-1
900;901;20237;A disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a ` bad ' police shooting .;0
885;886;19967;Carrying off a spot-on Scottish burr , Duvall -LRB- also a producer -RRB- peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper .;1
1004;1005;22318;-- was a fad that had long since vanished .;0
914;915;20474;If you adored The Full Monty so resoundingly that you 're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .;0
975;976;21806;An EXIT sign , that is .;-1
392;393;9446;In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .;0
348;349;8383;Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .;0
105;106;2739;A macabre and very stylized Swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .;1
924;925;20729;Another trumpet blast that there may be a New Mexican Cinema a-bornin ' . ';1
341;342;8239;With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .;0
658;659;15401;In other words , it 's badder than bad .;-1
648;649;15087;It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .;-1
833;834;19006;Fast and funny , an action cartoon that 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd .;1
808;809;18437;I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .;1
690;691;16062;A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .;0
767;768;17732;It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .;0
942;943;21072;This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon .;1
533;534;12449;It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .;0
51;52;1401;Finally coming down off of Miramax 's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , Waking Up in Reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie .;0
728;729;16823;It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .;-1
356;357;8594;They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .;0
678;679;15819;This is not Chabrol 's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer .;0
277;278;6942;A mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book .;0
1001;1002;22270;An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .;-1
760;761;17563;The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .;0
767;768;17732;It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .;0
932;933;20911;You want to call Domino 's .;0
1064;1065;23485;A light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .;-1
824;825;18776;By not averting his eyes , Solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable .;1
999;1000;22255;Action - mechanical .;-1
894;895;20133;It 's all a rather shapeless good time ...;0
68;69;1846;is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it 's a love story as sanguine as its title .;1
446;447;10567;The directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge;0
606;607;14096;But I do .;0
913;914;20469;A captivating new film .;1
723;724;16757;Really is a pan-American movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart .;1
580;581;13488;One of the pleasures in Walter 's documentary ... is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject 's mysterious personality without ever explaining him .;0
825;826;18800;A remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive Eisenhower era about one suburban woman 's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life .;1
202;203;5144;Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .;0
135;136;3630;One of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces .;1
866;867;19685;a stereotype;-1
276;277;6930;The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .;-1
485;486;11269;... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .;-1
855;856;19496;There 's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes , plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme .;-1
560;561;13028;As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .;-1
412;413;9879;Bearable .;0
397;398;9551;This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .;-1
789;790;18105;It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .;0
421;422;10039;Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke;-1
24;25;687;The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .;0
481;482;11192;Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .;0
909;910;20363;This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .;1
1062;1063;23425;Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls .;-1
692;693;16105;They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .;-1
1021;1022;22603;As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .;0
128;129;3471;A brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it .;0

460;461;10853;In some ways , Lagaan is quintessential Bollywood .;0
437;438;10411;It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .;1
567;568;13209;It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .;1
742;743;17109;With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .;-1
115;116;3087;But when it does , you 're entirely unprepared .;0
1017;1018;22505;-LRB- A -RRB- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting .;1
614;615;14277;Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .;-1
214;215;5367;Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .;0
572;573;13307;Welles groupie\/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst .;1
301;302;7422;Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .;1
435;436;10360;The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .;-1
537;538;12543;There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .;1
402;403;9651;Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -;1
409;410;9829;Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .;0

511;512;11944;With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .;0
92;93;2414;Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .;-1

88;89;2315;It shows us a slice of life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable .;1
98;99;2581;It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .;0
212;213;5347;When it 's this rich and luscious , who cares ?;1
652;653;15179;The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .;0
550;551;12784;Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .;0
510;511;11900;One Hour Photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director Mark Romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .;-1

351;352;8479;It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .;0

464;465;10896;The auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug .;1

217;218;5480;An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .;1
470;471;11024;Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .;-1
569;570;13233;Nair and writer Laura Cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .;0
0;1;1;A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .;-1
118;119;3151;The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , B movie way , they succeed .;1
509;510;11860;Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .;0
37;38;1024;The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . ';-1
626;627;14563;It 's just rather leaden and dull .;-1
519;520;12147;The Santa Clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .;1
148;149;3905;Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them , Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp through horror and hellish conditions .;0
181;182;4749;Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama;1
577;578;13434;Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .;1
1028;1029;22733;Interesting , but not compelling .;0
335;336;8125;This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .;-1

977;978;21840;The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .;1

599;600;13931;The early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us .;1
836;837;19080;Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .;0

296;297;7269;While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .;1
294;295;7242;What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .;0
715;716;16602;... a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on Rice 's second installment of her Vampire Chronicles .;0

679;680;15838;The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death .;1

374;375;8991;Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and Heaven is one such beast .;1

262;263;6602;Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .;1
826;827;18837;Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .;-1
727;728;16815;It 's exactly what you 'd expect .;0
476;477;11118;A puzzling experience .;0
425;426;10133;Though writer\/director Bart Freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of Crudup 's anchoring performance .;1

308;309;7624;Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .;1
603;604;14036;A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences .;-1
434;435;10345;It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .;1

962;963;21509;Star\/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own .;1

27;28;742;While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .;-1

770;771;17765;The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .;0
798;799;18291;Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .;0
503;504;11663;A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .;1
