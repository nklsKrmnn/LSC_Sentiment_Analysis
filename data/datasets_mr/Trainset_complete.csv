356;357;8594;They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .;2
862;863;19628;Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before .;1

168;169;4474;Those who love Cinema Paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved .;2
38;39;1051;Do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going .;3
919;920;20606;An uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , The Grey Zone does have a center , though a morbid one .;0
372;373;8939;Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .;2
255;256;6449;A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .;3
901;902;20258;Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .;0

599;600;13931;The early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us .;4
1038;1039;22978;The modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases;4
451;452;10658;Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .;1
226;227;5717;It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .;0
268;269;6708;Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods .;4

994;995;22167;What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .;0
598;599;13912;Falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice .;1
70;71;1918;But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness .;1
1036;1037;22914;Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .;1
445;446;10550;A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given .;4
616;617;14309;The immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary Space Station 3D .;4
181;182;4749;Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama;3
178;179;4684;Beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing .;4
291;292;7153;Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .;2

602;603;13990;Writer and director Otar Iosseliani 's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in Venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls .;4
753;754;17367;Less an examination of neo-Nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .;3

669;670;15628;Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there;2
674;675;15710;-LRB- Dong -RRB- makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets you riled up .;4
613;614;14238;The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .;2
146;147;3848;When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .;4

463;464;10880;Credit director Ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic .;3
128;129;3471;A brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it .;2

368;369;8853;Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .;0
206;207;5210;It 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Indian film culture that allows Americans to finally revel in its splendor .;4

1010;1011;22410;Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .;0
716;717;16625;Poetry in motion captured on film .;4
701;702;16256;The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .;3
913;914;20469;A captivating new film .;4
301;302;7422;Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .;3

513;514;11973;eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .;3
199;200;5104;The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .;2
991;992;22116;The film exudes the urbane sweetness that Woody Allen seems to have bitterly forsaken .;3
609;610;14141;It is an indelible epic American story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .;2
894;895;20133;It 's all a rather shapeless good time ...;2
672;673;15680;Delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information .;3
31;32;849;Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .;0

117;118;3123;300 years of Russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness .;4
380;381;9112;Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible .;4
182;183;4783;Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made Mamet 's `` House of Games '' and last fall 's `` Heist '' so much fun .;3
466;467;10932;Despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .;3
298;299;7323;A dreary movie .;0
782;783;17950;Disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical `` Bedknobs and Broomsticks , '' which also dealt with British children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime .;2
112;113;2972;The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .;0
256;257;6465;Now as a former Gong Show addict , I 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .;3

499;500;11597;So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .;1
222;223;5597;Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .;0
366;367;8798;Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .;3

384;385;9206;Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .;4
299;300;7327;Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .;1
615;616;14287;This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .;1
37;38;1024;The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . ';0
590;591;13721;The next big thing 's not-so-big -LRB- and not-so-hot -RRB- directorial debut .;2
278;279;6956;Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .;0
819;820;18697;Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary .;2
961;962;21482;Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .;3
288;289;7123;Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .;4
218;219;5517;Cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation -LRB- career - kids = misery -RRB- in tiresome romantic-comedy duds .;1
31;32;849;Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .;0
963;964;21551;This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected .;3
826;827;18837;Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .;1
312;313;7715;A solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket .;3
594;595;13784;There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics;3
739;740;17066;Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .;1
506;507;11754;But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .;0
435;436;10360;The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .;1
333;334;8094;Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema .;4
968;969;21642;It pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .;2
853;854;19481;A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .;2
534;535;12464;If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? '';1
123;124;3273;It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison .;2
891;892;20097;`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .;0
752;753;17349;It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .;3
233;234;5857;Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .;0
797;798;18269;More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .;0
777;778;17885;A small movie with a big heart .;3
188;189;4878;The result might look like Vulgar .;2
279;280;6981;In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .;0
228;229;5768;Jolting into Charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -LRB- accurate ?;2
55;56;1523;Both lead performances are Oscar-size .;4
180;181;4729;The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .;1
859;860;19585;It will break your heart many times over .;2
177;178;4666;Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .;0
357;358;8609;The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .;2
234;235;5877;Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents;0
652;653;15179;The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .;2
393;394;9465;As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .;4
881;882;19905;Charlotte Sometimes is a brilliant movie .;4

864;865;19659;A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .;0
790;791;18126;The movie is a trove of delights .;4
107;108;2804;The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .;2

901;902;20258;Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .;0
547;548;12722;After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .;0
63;64;1716;The characters are more deeply thought through than in most ` right-thinking ' films .;3
253;254;6391;Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .;1
674;675;15710;-LRB- Dong -RRB- makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets you riled up .;4

715;716;16602;... a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on Rice 's second installment of her Vampire Chronicles .;2
821;822;18730;Metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story .;3
591;592;13735;If you 're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life , Eisenstein delivers .;3
138;139;3687;The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .;0
932;933;20911;You want to call Domino 's .;2
35;36;971;They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .;1
496;497;11524;Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .;4
705;706;16413;A real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .;4
372;373;8939;Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .;2
292;293;7163;Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .;1

127;128;3417;Keenly observed and refreshingly natural , Swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in Myrtle Beach , S.C. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner .;3
653;654;15204;You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .;3

716;717;16625;Poetry in motion captured on film .;4
251;252;6305;The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .;0
112;113;2972;The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .;0
333;334;8094;Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema .;4
166;167;4426;Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .;0
593;594;13773;A visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .;4
438;439;10438;A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .;1

835;836;19054;Not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season .;4
234;235;5877;Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents;0
344;345;8287;The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .;3
789;790;18105;It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .;2
686;687;16007;Director Claude Chabrol has become the master of innuendo .;3
676;677;15785;In his debut as a director , Washington has a sure hand .;4
928;929;20804;Collateral Damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it were n't .;0
1049;1050;23173;Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .;0
172;173;4550;Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .;2
846;847;19289;This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .;0
11;12;307;Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .;1

119;120;3181;Mr. Polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .;3

402;403;9651;Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -;3

847;848;19303;Maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts .;3

500;501;11610;Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .;4
1028;1029;22733;Interesting , but not compelling .;2
52;53;1446;Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .;0
186;187;4859;There 's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments .;1
836;837;19080;Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .;2
637;638;14829;Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .;1
12;13;353;The performances are an absolute joy .;4
1049;1050;23173;Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .;0
500;501;11610;Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .;4
810;811;18482;It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .;1
808;809;18437;I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .;3
85;86;2244;Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co-writer Ed Decter .;1
745;746;17176;The large-frame IMAX camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .;4
666;667;15549;Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .;1
721;722;16718;Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about Zelda 's ultimate fate .;4
42;43;1165;If a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then They works spectacularly well ... A shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .;4
794;795;18205;A well-executed spy-thriller .;4
715;716;16602;... a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on Rice 's second installment of her Vampire Chronicles .;2
427;428;10196;This beautifully animated epic is never dull .;4
330;331;8039;But though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .;3
439;440;10450;Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .;1
387;388;9301;Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .;4
45;46;1225;Less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling -LRB- though no less horrifying for it -RRB- .;3
502;503;11656;The cast comes through even when the movie does n't .;2
251;252;6305;The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .;0
887;888;20023;Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .;4
407;408;9812;Consistently clever and suspenseful .;4
388;389;9326;The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Everyman is in the details .;3
514;515;11985;Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .;1
931;932;20887;It 's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .;2
494;495;11487;An exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama .;4
441;442;10484;Mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt .;2
101;102;2654;A surprisingly ` solid ' achievement by director Malcolm D. Lee and writer John Ridley .;3
108;109;2841;Filmmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power .;4
610;611;14173;It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .;4
306;307;7555;A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .;1
434;435;10345;It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .;4
697;698;16170;The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have loved it .;4
250;251;6287;The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol .;3
577;578;13434;Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .;4
630;631;14627;The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .;2
79;80;2087;An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud .;4
876;877;19849;` The War of the Roses , ' trailer-trash style .;0
690;691;16062;A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .;2
635;636;14777;This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential;3
208;209;5267;... only Bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction .;2
995;996;22208;I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .;0
41;42;1135;Vincent Gallo is right at home in this French shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role .;3
912;913;20446;Opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half .;2
841;842;19191;After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .;1
685;686;15980;It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .;3
949;950;21225;For most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche .;3
876;877;19849;` The War of the Roses , ' trailer-trash style .;0
813;814;18538;If cinema had been around to capture the chaos of France in the 1790 's , one imagines the result would look like something like this .;3
341;342;8239;With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .;2
282;283;7053;I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .;2
570;571;13280;Goofy , nutty , consistently funny .;4
389;390;9344;The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .;1
309;310;7648;Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .;4
5;6;167;A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .;4
486;487;11298;It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .;0
464;465;10896;The auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug .;3
473;474;11095;An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema .;4
1;2;64;This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .;4
370;371;8894;Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . ';1
783;784;17991;These guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers .;1
277;278;6942;A mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book .;2
638;639;14850;The filmmakers ' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls ' environment .;3
205;206;5182;Monte Cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .;4
622;623;14458;An hour and a half of joyful solo performance .;4
39;40;1088;So could young romantics out on a date .;3
74;75;1984;Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .;1
700;701;16234;Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .;1
164;165;4337;Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .;3
1019;1020;22535;For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .;3
1008;1009;22378;is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .;2
465;466;10922;Gets better after Foster leaves that little room .;3
365;366;8776;With or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller;4
276;277;6930;The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .;0
25;26;703;It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .;2
1008;1009;22378;is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .;2
1012;1013;22432;That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . '';1
320;321;7883;So original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up .;4
874;875;19821;An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .;3
811;812;18510;Bernal and;2
471;472;11061;Definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . ';3
324;325;7973;See it .;4
419;420;9996;plays like some corny television production from a bygone era;1
814;815;18567;Slight but enjoyable documentary .;3
28;29;787;The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen .;1

42;43;1165;If a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then They works spectacularly well ... A shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .;4
337;338;8169;One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .;0
230;231;5798;Williams plays Sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in Insomnia .;2
1010;1011;22410;Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .;0
562;563;13088;Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .;1
860;861;19592;This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .;1
908;909;20338;Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .;0
444;445;10544;The concept is a hoot .;3
1000;1001;22258;None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .;1
235;236;5894;In an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , Narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve .;3
636;637;14818;As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .;4
661;662;15448;Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .;1
630;631;14627;The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .;2
664;665;15513;You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .;2

412;413;9879;Bearable .;2
328;329;8028;A relative letdown .;0

944;945;21108;About Schmidt is Nicholson 's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing King Lear .;3
490;491;11429;This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .;0
93;94;2453;Writer\/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .;3
1063;1064;23443;With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .;1

429;430;10212;In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .;1
704;705;16376;Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . '';3
236;237;5935;A rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hairs on your chest .;3
506;507;11754;But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .;0

498;499;11584;Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed .;3
364;365;8745;The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .;0

436;437;10371;Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .;1

618;619;14362;Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .;1
896;897;20161;No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .;0
195;196;5022;The film can depress you about life itself .;1
474;475;11104;An extremely unpleasant film .;0
529;530;12374;... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year .;4
915;916;20508;Worth catching for Griffiths ' warm and winning central performance .;3
391;392;9416;Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .;3
723;724;16757;Really is a pan-American movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart .;3
732;733;16908;It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .;3
381;382;9149;Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .;0
183;184;4813;The film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once .;3
223;224;5627;The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .;1
983;984;21964;`` Red Dragon '' never cuts corners .;3
771;772;17791;Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .;4
447;448;10592;What Eric Schaeffer has accomplished with Never Again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary .;2
1054;1055;23278;Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .;0

15;16;424;A welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story .;3
787;788;18067;I love the opening scenes of a wintry New York City in 1899 .;3
961;962;21482;Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .;3

556;557;12955;Make Chan 's action sequences boring .;1

1004;1005;22318;-- was a fad that had long since vanished .;2
695;696;16149;A piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .;2

140;141;3713;Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .;0
472;473;11082;A heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope .;3
909;910;20363;This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .;4
732;733;16908;It has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing .;3
946;947;21156;This is a very funny , heartwarming film .;4
62;63;1687;Its generic villains lack any intrigue -LRB- other than their funny accents -RRB- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .;1
58;59;1569;Claude Chabrol 's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements .;3

294;295;7242;What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .;2
64;65;1735;The film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun .;3
599;600;13931;The early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us .;4
386;387;9262;`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .;2

724;725;16775;Same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse .;2
832;833;18962;More than anything else , Kissing Jessica Stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake Sleepless in Seattle again and again .;4
977;978;21840;The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .;4

797;798;18269;More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .;0
789;790;18105;It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .;2

939;940;21003;To those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer 's ` Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood , ' but that 's not saying much .;3
491;492;11445;As saccharine as it is disposable .;1
248;249;6254;It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .;3

373;374;8956;An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .;4
27;28;742;While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .;1

921;922;20653;So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .;0
170;171;4515;Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .;0
78;79;2071;This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .;1
925;926;20747;Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .;1
414;415;9904;But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them .;3
503;504;11663;A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .;3

410;411;9843;A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .;1
906;907;20310;Somehow Ms. Griffiths and Mr. Pryce bring off this wild Welsh whimsy .;3
80;81;2102;All in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own .;3
252;253;6352;Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .;3

1055;1056;23292;... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels .;4

865;866;19671;The sword fighting is well done and Auteuil is a goofy pleasure .;3
531;532;12423;This is one of Mr. Chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny .;3

835;836;19054;Not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season .;4
83;84;2218;Inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening .;3
485;486;11269;... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .;0
1022;1023;22625;Alternately frustrating and rewarding .;3

119;120;3181;Mr. Polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .;3
844;845;19247;The Bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they 've told a nice little story in the process .;4
49;50;1333;Bloody Sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made .;4

970;971;21724;It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...;0
504;505;11698;It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .;3
1035;1036;22877;-LRB- Stephen -RRB- Earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have .;3

166;167;4426;Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .;0
89;90;2338;Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .;1
840;841;19174;Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .;4
201;202;5131;But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .;1
581;582;13534;Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .;1

477;478;11122;Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .;2
420;421;10004;It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .;4
1037;1038;22939;Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .;1

274;275;6847;Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .;1
1066;1067;23553;It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .;1
95;96;2504;Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion .;4

1001;1002;22270;An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .;0

1051;1052;23228;finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed;4

43;44;1199;This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .;1

497;498;11570;She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit .;3
947;948;21164;It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .;3
94;95;2473;Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .;0

558;559;12978;The Wild Thornberrys Movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate .;3
997;998;22224;I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .;1

622;623;14458;An hour and a half of joyful solo performance .;4

511;512;11944;With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .;2
508;509;11801;I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .;4
245;246;6180;This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .;4
765;766;17703;A quiet , disquieting triumph .;3
799;800;18303;In the affable Maid in Manhattan , Jennifer Lopez 's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly A-list players .;3

170;171;4515;Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .;0

326;327;7981;A guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it .;2
955;956;21391;What 's invigorating about it is that it does n't give a damn .;3
480;481;11171;This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .;1
244;245;6143;Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .;3
200;201;5121;A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .;1
655;656;15295;Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .;1
214;215;5367;Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .;2

21;22;564;Hatfield and Hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications .;3
296;297;7269;While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .;4
523;524;12248;Goes on and on to the point of nausea .;1
646;647;15040;Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .;0
966;967;21616;There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .;1

893;894;20122;Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end .;0

773;774;17823;Stage director Sam Mendes showcases Tom Hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge .;3
898;899;20201;The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between .;1
196;197;5030;If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .;1
976;977;21811;It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .;2
316;317;7799;Except it 's much , much better .;4
23;24;648;That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .;2
348;349;8383;Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .;2
1043;1044;23053;But once the falcon arrives in the skies above Manhattan , the adventure is on red alert .;3
264;265;6660;In fact , even better .;3

1032;1033;22835;Eh .;2
492;493;11453;Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics .;4
84;85;2235;Tells a fascinating , compelling story .;4
361;362;8693;An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .;1
578;579;13463;A perceptive , good-natured movie .;3
462;463;10872;A wry , affectionate delight .;4
481;482;11192;Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .;2

788;789;18082;If -LRB- Jaglom 's -RRB- latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing .;3
885;886;19967;Carrying off a spot-on Scottish burr , Duvall -LRB- also a producer -RRB- peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper .;3
880;881;19897;... pitiful , slapdash disaster .;0
1025;1026;22657;Anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .;4

365;366;8776;With or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller;4
376;377;9024;Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misunderstood career .;4
878;879;19873;A fifty car pileup of cliches .;0
626;627;14563;It 's just rather leaden and dull .;0
96;97;2520;`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .;0
520;521;12173;Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .;0
36;37;1003;It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .;1
937;938;20985;The whole affair is as predictable as can be .;2
734;735;16952;Perhaps the best sports movie I 've ever seen .;4
852;853;19449;Affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with Spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together .;3
334;335;8114;The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .;3
1025;1026;22657;Anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .;4
989;990;22071;It 's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .;3
807;808;18423;It may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer .;3
92;93;2414;Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .;1
476;477;11118;A puzzling experience .;2
382;383;9168;This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .;0
328;329;8028;A relative letdown .;0
124;125;3305;Winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars .;3
856;857;19530;A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .;1
948;949;21193;I was amused and entertained by the unfolding of Bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .;4
67;68;1840;It 's like a drive-by .;1
696;697;16164;This movie is to be cherished .;4
854;855;19488;It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .;1
974;975;21802;Clever but not especially compelling .;2
981;982;21938;` Rare Birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .;2
926;927;20764;Only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of Elizabeth Berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm .;1
479;480;11167;Intelligent and moving .;4
896;897;20161;No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .;0
712;713;16561;Ferrara 's best film in years .;4
318;319;7840;There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .;2
805;806;18416;... one resurrection too many .;1
297;298;7298;There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .;4
542;543;12626;What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .;3
144;145;3800;It lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho .;3
564;565;13134;Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .;4
942;943;21072;This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon .;3
831;832;18943;Decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like .;2
303;304;7500;What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .;3
748;749;17241;dramatic snapshot;3
768;769;17746;Hugely accomplished slice of Hitchcockian suspense .;3
94;95;2473;Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .;0
586;587;13668;Not just unlikable .;1
818;819;18665;All the actors are good in Pauline & Paulette but van der Groen , described as ` Belgium 's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as Pauline .;2
608;609;14117;Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .;1
485;486;11269;... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .;0
572;573;13307;Welles groupie\/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst .;3
266;267;6684;Proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie .;2
122;123;3265;Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .;1
1055;1056;23292;... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels .;4
23;24;648;That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .;2
126;127;3368;A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause .;4
858;859;19555;An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .;1
565;566;13166;This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .;3
505;506;11740;Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .;2
838;839;19128;Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .;3
923;924;20707;A pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties .;3
440;441;10467;Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .;1
401;402;9629;The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .;2
371;372;8906;`` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .;4
109;110;2865;A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .;1
448;449;10614;Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .;0
392;393;9446;In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .;2
1002;1003;22303;Wait to see it then .;1
525;526;12289;It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .;1
224;225;5665;The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .;0
589;590;13701;It 's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages .;4
1020;1021;22584;The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .;4
563;564;13113;Evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes .;1
659;660;15412;Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .;0
605;606;14075;Though Haynes ' style apes films from the period ... its message is not rooted in that decade .;2
217;218;5480;An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .;3
68;69;1846;is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it 's a love story as sanguine as its title .;3
585;586;13654;By no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one .;3
837;838;19115;A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .;1
749;750;17274;What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .;2
484;485;11263;It should have stayed there .;1
216;217;5429;A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .;1
249;250;6282;Black-and-white and unrealistic .;0
1013;1014;22453;Solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .;2
84;85;2235;Tells a fascinating , compelling story .;4
933;934;20918;The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer 's putrid pond of retread action twaddle .;2

990;991;22095;No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .;1
399;400;9598;Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .;3
691;692;16083;The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .;3
766;767;17709;A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms .;0
270;271;6766;A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last .;4
245;246;6180;This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .;4
383;384;9188;Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .;1
474;475;11104;An extremely unpleasant film .;0
1014;1015;22466;Includes too much obvious padding .;1
683;684;15944;If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .;2
517;518;12075;I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .;0
5;6;167;A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .;4
65;66;1755;Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .;0
508;509;11801;I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .;4
44;45;1216;Fortunately , you still have that option .;2
31;32;849;Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .;0
298;299;7323;A dreary movie .;0
220;221;5569;His work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories .;3
351;352;8479;It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .;2
688;689;16037;It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars;0
663;664;15491;With an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera;3
714;715;16591;No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .;3
1034;1035;22858;The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .;2
909;910;20363;This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .;4
738;739;17026;In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .;1
175;176;4628;Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .;0
384;385;9206;Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .;4
311;312;7708;... irritating soul-searching garbage .;0
729;730;16852;You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .;0
197;198;5056;You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .;1
243;244;6112;Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .;2
298;299;7323;A dreary movie .;0

390;391;9384;Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .;1
345;346;8333;Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .;1
884;885;19954;An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .;0
418;419;9982;Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .;0
644;645;14990;... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .;4
289;290;7141;A slight but sweet film .;3
798;799;18291;Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .;2
921;922;20653;So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .;0
478;479;11150;I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .;4
482;483;11222;The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .;3
986;987;21995;Bland but harmless .;1

336;337;8160;The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...;2
287;288;7109;Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .;3
922;923;20669;Satin Rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it 's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .;3
593;594;13773;A visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .;4
967;968;21633;A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work .;4
316;317;7799;Except it 's much , much better .;4
113;114;3022;Whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us .;3
967;968;21633;A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work .;4
129;130;3493;A triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light .;4
260;261;6557;A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .;2
546;547;12699;Schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness .;1
795;796;18210;The stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt .;2

199;200;5104;The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .;2
994;995;22167;What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .;0

56;57;1531;Run for your lives !;0
973;974;21776;It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .;2

98;99;2581;It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .;2
855;856;19496;There 's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes , plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme .;0
595;596;13836;It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift .;2
247;248;6226;Sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first -LRB- as best I remember -RRB- , but still a very good time at the cinema .;4
840;841;19174;Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .;4
657;658;15360;Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .;1
294;295;7242;What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .;2
720;721;16687;It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists .;2
617;618;14340;A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .;0
46;47;1258;As tricky and satisfying as any of David Mamet 's airless cinematic shell games .;3
771;772;17791;Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .;4

1048;1049;23147;A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .;1
1030;1031;22765;An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .;2
607;608;14099;A compelling allegory about the last days of Germany 's democratic Weimar Republic .;3
597;598;13892;I ca n't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail .;2
625;626;14542;Exploits -LRB- headbanger -RRB- stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter .;3
780;781;17934;Essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty .;3
1006;1007;22343;Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .;1
900;901;20237;A disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a ` bad ' police shooting .;2
646;647;15040;Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .;0
433;434;10319;Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .;2
958;959;21431;The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed .;3
460;461;10853;In some ways , Lagaan is quintessential Bollywood .;2
628;629;14585;Although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters .;3
979;980;21913;Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .;3
140;141;3713;Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .;0
649;650;15103;Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?;0
769;770;17754;A generic international version of a typical American horror film .;1
121;122;3263;Absorbing character;2
288;289;7123;Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .;4
215;216;5399;Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .;0
613;614;14238;The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .;2
872;873;19787;The best part about `` Gangs '' was Daniel Day-Lewis .;3
1007;1008;22359;I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .;2
1379;1380;29765;It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .;3
1648;1649;35065;Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .;1
1383;1384;29864;A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .;1
1507;1508;32179;Nicole Kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that Birthday Girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while .;3
1903;1904;39839;The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .;2
1263;1264;27515;The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .;1
1491;1492;31838;That ` Alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of Witherspoon -LRB- who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate -RRB- ...;3
1372;1373;29613;There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .;0
1523;1524;32527;It does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .;3
1376;1377;29716;The power of Shanghai Ghetto , a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s .;3
2127;2128;43896;The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .;1
2128;2129;43921;... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .;1
1630;1631;34690;It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .;2
1849;1850;38785;A tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .;3
1394;1395;30052;This thing is virtually unwatchable .;0
1878;1879;39361;Why ?;1
2077;2078;43046;To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .;1
1552;1553;33119;All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .;2
1860;1861;39009;If you do n't laugh , flee .;2
1303;1304;28288;Otherwise , maybe .;2
2112;2113;43635;An honest , sensitive story from a Vietnamese point of view .;4
2044;2045;42430;A special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento ...;4
1985;1986;41345;Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .;1
1532;1533;32692;Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .;0
1744;1745;36834;Like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen 's astringent wit .;3
1594;1595;33954;Should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike .;3
1176;1177;25754;Where the film falters is in its tone .;1
1559;1560;33293;So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .;0
1675;1676;35579;Gently humorous and touching .;3
1287;1288;28041;It still feels like a prison stretch .;1
2087;2088;43221;It 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .;4
1286;1287;28017;Though filmed partly in Canada , Paid in Full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the Reagan years .;3
2062;2063;42736;Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .;0
1405;1406;30278;It wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy Hawaiian shirt .;1
1573;1574;33555;An overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort .;3
1476;1477;31545;With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .;0
1460;1461;31266;This familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it 's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times .;3
1547;1548;33032;It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .;0
1853;1854;38845;"That the real Antwone Fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle .";4
1874;1875;39286;Boring and meandering .;0
1536;1537;32801;Many of Benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice .;2
1826;1827;38364;For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .;0
1599;1600;34049;Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .;0
1769;1770;37272;A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .;2
1969;1970;41087;The search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because Blanchett and Ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering .;4
2018;2019;41979;fast , frantic and fun , but also soon forgotten;2
1572;1573;33527;Vividly demonstrates that the director of such Hollywood blockbusters as Patriot Games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop .;4
1560;1561;33311;Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .;1
1241;1242;27024;A touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community .;3
1542;1543;32937;The main problem being that it 's only a peek .;2
1774;1775;37389;`` Not really as bad as you might think ! '';2
1649;1650;35087;Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White 's dry wit to a new age .;4
2091;2092;43301;is one of this year 's very best pictures .;4
1385;1386;29898;The simplicity of The Way Home has few equals this side of Aesop;2
1328;1329;28697;It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .;3
2013;2014;41840;The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .;1
1338;1339;28881;The Trinity Assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and George Ratliff 's documentary , Hell House , reflects their earnestness -- which makes for a terrifying film .;2
1189;1190;25999;The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .;0
1292;1293;28133;After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .;2
1222;1223;26654;The Santa Clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry .;1
2102;2103;43503;A pale Xerox of other , better crime movies .;1
1452;1453;31128;Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .;0
1171;1172;25649;It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .;0
1217;1218;26551;Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !;2
1544;1545;32983;But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .;0
1893;1894;39666;De Ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .;2
1207;1208;26355;A party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid .;1
1209;1210;26386;A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .;0
2006;2007;41699;The sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .;2
1808;1809;38035;Bill Morrison 's Decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .;4
1397;1398;30116;And , thanks to the presence of ` the King , ' it also rocks .;3
1653;1654;35179;What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .;2
1888;1889;39567;Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .;0
2050;2051;42547;Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .;2
1354;1355;29266;Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .;0
1477;1478;31570;The film oozes craft .;3
1492;1493;31881;Starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and Bruce Willis with a scar .;0
1886;1887;39515;The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .;1
1262;1263;27482;Where Janice Beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .;3
1896;1897;39720;A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .;1
1278;1279;27848;In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition;1
2068;2069;42841;A charmer from Belgium .;3
1115;1116;24516;LaBute masterfully balances both Traditional or Modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other .;4
1753;1754;37025;Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .;1
1750;1751;36945;Directed with purpose and finesse by England 's Roger Mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as Notting Hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft .;4
1270;1271;27678;Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up .;4
1411;1412;30419;Your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , Madonna 's cameo does n't suck !;3
1488;1489;31770;It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .;4
1642;1643;34913;It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .;3
1438;1439;30907;Alas , another breathless movie about same !;2
1122;1123;24651;The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .;1
1231;1232;26844;Blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch-perfect Holden .;4
1645;1646;34982;Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved;0
1323;1324;28618;Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , The Four Feathers comes up short .;0
1140;1141;25015;The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .;0
1603;1604;34148;That 's because relatively nothing happens .;1
1993;1994;41461;A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .;0
1436;1437;30873;There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .;2
1722;1723;36424;A knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite Son of the Bride .;4
1347;1348;29121;` Drumline ' shows a level of young , Black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated .;4
1461;1462;31299;Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .;0
1905;1906;39887;The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .;1
1380;1381;29780;The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .;0
1123;1124;24676;The film is one of the year 's best .;4
1276;1277;27804;A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .;0
1965;1966;41003;It 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by Kwan 's unique directing style .;4
1505;1506;32143;A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .;0
1755;1756;37062;Elvira fans could hardly ask for more .;4
1485;1486;31705;A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .;0
1761;1762;37149;... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . '';1
1910;1911;39960;Predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director John Stockwell .;3
1706;1707;36132;A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .;1
1362;1363;29405;What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .;0
1202;1203;26254;The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .;2
2045;2046;42447;... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .;2
1784;1785;37562;A delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie .;4
1534;1535;32736;Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .;2
1568;1569;33450;Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .;0
1749;1750;36929;But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .;4
1736;1737;36672;Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .;0
1208;1209;26366;A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .;4
1145;1146;25071;One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .;1
1756;1757;37069;Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .;2
1103;1104;24299;Although commentary on Nachtwey is provided ... it 's the image that really tells the tale .;3
1218;1219;26567;I do n't know if Frailty will turn Bill Paxton into an A-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie .;3
1363;1364;29426;The sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in IMAX dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins .;3
1105;1106;24321;Instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions .;3
1600;1601;34071;On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .;2
1456;1457;31194;Overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper .;1
2065;2066;42808;A wild , endearing , masterful documentary .;4
1524;1525;32540;Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .;2
1264;1265;27526;A dazzling dream of a documentary .;4
1435;1436;30847;The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .;4

1859;1860;38990;`` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .;2
1994;1995;41480;An empty , purposeless exercise .;0
1745;1746;36856;A taut , sobering film .;4
1083;1084;23851;Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .;1
1223;1224;26680;An energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching -LRB- or turntablism -RRB- in particular .;4
1776;1777;37414;Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .;1
1484;1485;31669;Old people will love this movie , and I mean that in the nicest possible way : Last Orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship .;2
1440;1441;30929;If you do n't ... well , skip to another review .;2
1678;1679;35647;Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .;2
1691;1692;35855;The worst film of the year .;0
1597;1598;34017;, is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly .;3
1694;1695;35919;Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .;2
1457;1458;31200;Steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate Manhattan denizens -- especially the a \*\* holes .;2
1121;1122;24635;`` -LRB- Hopkins -RRB- does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it .;1
1359;1360;29348;After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .;0
1517;1518;32384;A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .;1
1534;1535;32736;Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .;2
1932;1933;40400;The Bourne Identity should n't be half as entertaining as it is , but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood .;3
1694;1695;35919;Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .;2
2124;2125;43856;would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed ` The French Lieutenant 's Woman . ';3
1329;1330;28708;A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .;1
1368;1369;29550;Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .;0
1757;1758;37080;Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .;4
1270;1271;27678;Clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , Slap Her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up .;4
1730;1731;36586;I had more fun watching Spy than I had with most of the big summer movies .;4
1822;1823;38300;This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .;1
1888;1889;39567;Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .;0
2057;2058;42660;Full of surprises .;3
1408;1409;30340;But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .;0
1478;1479;31575;Stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .;3
2122;2123;43787;The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .;1
1661;1662;35337;It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .;0
1226;1227;26750;Compellingly watchable .;4
1770;1771;37316;`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .;0
1081;1082;23806;On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .;0
1106;1107;24344;the film belongs to the marvelous Verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public;3
1113;1114;24482;Not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .;4
1409;1410;30361;Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .;3
1336;1337;28842;The actors are fantastic .;4

1795;1796;37730;Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .;3
1836;1837;38530;It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .;1

1973;1974;41175;It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless .;3

1247;1248;27112;Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .;0
1452;1453;31128;Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .;0

1086;1087;23923;Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .;2
2050;2051;42547;Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .;2
1775;1776;37399;Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .;3
1949;1950;40682;In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .;2
2107;2108;43543;Sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .;1
1609;1610;34273;As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .;4
2114;2115;43647;Beautifully produced .;4
1510;1511;32237;The characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life .;4
1352;1353;29230;A beautifully observed character piece .;4
1499;1500;32034;A genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives .;4
1268;1269;27639;Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .;3
1923;1924;40165;Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .;4
1311;1312;28376;-LRB- Washington 's -RRB- strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene .;4
1659;1660;35301;Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . ';1
1264;1265;27526;A dazzling dream of a documentary .;4
1505;1506;32143;A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .;0
1847;1848;38754;Both deserve better .;1
1370;1371;29582;An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .;0
1485;1486;31705;A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .;0
1951;1952;40726;The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side .;1
1547;1548;33032;It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .;0
1623;1624;34554;The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance .;3
1857;1858;38950;Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .;0
1459;1460;31251;Jeffrey Tambor 's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is Oscar-worthy .;4
1550;1551;33075;If you 're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake .;1
1959;1960;40890;A beyond-lame satire , Teddy Bears ' Picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .;1
1441;1442;30939;In my opinion , Analyze That is not as funny or entertaining as Analyze This , but it is a respectable sequel .;2
1404;1405;30273;It 's just not very smart .;1
1663;1664;35399;A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .;4
1740;1741;36736;And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .;0
2059;2060;42668;Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation .;1
1508;1509;32213;It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .;2
2087;2088;43221;It 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .;4
1428;1429;30714;I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .;0
1604;1605;34154;` Snow Dogs ' has both .;2
1117;1118;24562;Anemic , pretentious .;1
2066;2067;42815;Cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh .;4
1298;1299;28219;Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .;0
1295;1296;28183;The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .;1
1940;1941;40553;A thriller without a lot of thrills .;0
1248;1249;27134;With Notorious C.H.O. Cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with Pryor , Carlin and Murphy .;3
2016;2017;41923;... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .;0
1634;1635;34755;American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .;1
1621;1622;34525;A reality-snubbing hodgepodge .;1
1377;1378;29757;Funny and touching .;3
2034;2035;42266;Bring on the sequel .;3
1172;1173;25668;aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there 's little to be learned from watching ` Comedian ';2
1590;1591;33879;A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .;0
1739;1740;36726;It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .;1
1365;1366;29482;Williams absolutely nails Sy 's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness .;3
1231;1232;26844;Blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch-perfect Holden .;4
1464;1465;31336;No. .;1
1823;1824;38311;A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .;0
1394;1395;30052;This thing is virtually unwatchable .;0
1884;1885;39467;-LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .;1
1876;1877;39314;The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .;4
1997;1998;41508;Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .;1
1574;1575;33579;It 's still terrible !;0

1987;1988;41367;Clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable ...;3
1823;1824;38311;A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .;0
1931;1932;40364;It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .;1
1710;1711;36193;I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .;1
1408;1409;30340;But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .;0
2019;2020;41988;Deliciously slow .;3
1468;1469;31415;You have to see it .;4
1646;1647;35002;There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a Hollywood career , if they want one .;3
1563;1564;33371;The film was n't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .;2
1555;1556;33191;A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .;2
1865;1866;39087;The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .;0
1780;1781;37495;What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .;1
2008;2009;41729;Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .;0
1652;1653;35158;It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .;0
1472;1473;31461;Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .;1
1422;1423;30617;"The history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling .";4
2026;2027;42110;Australian actor\/director John Polson and award-winning English cinematographer Giles Nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation .;3
1794;1795;37721;The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .;0
1221;1222;26637;Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .;2
1548;1549;33047;The actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script 's bad ideas and awkwardness .;3
1776;1777;37414;Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .;1
1682;1683;35709;Represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging Indian American cinema .;3
1325;1326;28653;Nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining .;3
1740;1741;36736;And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .;0
1803;1804;37925;"Those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up .";3
1250;1251;27165;the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times;0

2097;2098;43384;Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .;1
2045;2046;42447;... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .;2
1831;1832;38450;This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .;0
1181;1182;25817;But here 's a movie about it anyway .;1
1186;1187;25895;Like Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .;0
1826;1827;38364;For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .;0
1887;1888;39550;Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .;1
2125;2126;43875;Harmless fun .;3
1999;2000;41531;The kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .;4
1098;1099;24178;The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .;0
1777;1778;37446;One of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning .;4
1944;1945;40621;As Antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion .;3
1284;1285;27993;There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .;2
1708;1709;36172;of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation;3
2064;2065;42779;Beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images .;3
1930;1931;40325;Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .;1
1613;1614;34374;It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .;2
1072;1073;23619;A compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother 's hold over her .;3
1961;1962;40938;A dreary indulgence .;2
1367;1368;29515;This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . ';0
1587;1588;33763;... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .;0
1442;1443;30961;A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .;0
1726;1727;36511;Ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .;3
1754;1755;37046;Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .;2
1111;1112;24445;Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .;0
1608;1609;34234;Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .;2
1719;1720;36372;"This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .";1
1324;1325;28643;Enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast .;4
1213;1214;26461;If you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , Sweet Home Alabama is diverting in the manner of Jeff Foxworthy 's stand-up act .;2
1797;1798;37798;Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters .;3
1265;1266;27531;An intelligently made -LRB- and beautifully edited -RRB- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the Hollywood pipeline without a hitch .;4
1939;1940;40532;All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .;2
1748;1749;36899;The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .;4
1359;1360;29348;After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .;0
1466;1467;31369;It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .;0
1090;1091;24028;Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .;0
1457;1458;31200;Steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate Manhattan denizens -- especially the a \*\* holes .;2
1481;1482;31626;But it does somehow manage to get you under its spell .;3
1120;1121;24616;There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?;1
1495;1496;31952;Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche , No Such Thing is Hartley 's least accessible screed yet .;1
2047;2048;42478;Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .;0
1165;1166;25478;At its best when the guarded , resentful Betty and the manipulative yet needy Margot are front and center .;2
1639;1640;34834;Like its title character , this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .;3
1075;1076;23682;Jagger , Stoppard and director Michael Apted ... deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride .;4
1123;1124;24676;The film is one of the year 's best .;4
1581;1582;33682;Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .;1
1114;1115;24514;Truly terrible .;0
1380;1381;29780;The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .;0
1131;1132;24812;Light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .;4
1470;1471;31432;A tasty slice of droll whimsy .;2
1782;1783;37516;Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .;0
1731;1732;36601;It 's just merely very bad .;0

1805;1806;37971;Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...;0
2003;2004;41638;Director David Jacobson gives Dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims .;2
1799;1800;37851;The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .;4
1933;1934;40445;In -LRB- screenwriter -RRB- Charlie Kaufman 's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking .;2
1406;1407;30291;Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .;4
1320;1321;28591;If only there were one for this kind of movie .;2
1807;1808;38020;At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes .;2
1337;1338;28845;It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .;3

1880;1881;39380;It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .;1
1340;1341;28940;But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .;2
1589;1590;33846;The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .;2
1806;1807;37997;It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .;3
2007;2008;41715;What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?;1
1919;1920;40098;A true-blue delight .;4

1566;1567;33412;Grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to Toback 's Heidegger - and Nietzsche-referencing dialogue .;4

1962;1963;40942;A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .;1
1353;1354;29235;Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .;2

1816;1817;38200;Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .;1
1571;1572;33501;... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .;1

1704;1705;36113;He drags it back , single-handed .;3
1298;1299;28219;Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .;0

1955;1956;40812;Both Grant and Hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .;3

2130;2131;43967;Spielberg 's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later .;4
1315;1316;28450;A well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .;3
1986;1987;41351;The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .;1

1970;1971;41117;One suspects that Craven endorses They simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .;1

1614;1615;34390;One of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society .;3
1615;1616;34414;A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .;0
2086;2087;43198;It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .;2
2030;2031;42183;A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .;2
1868;1869;39170;About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .;1
1143;1144;25057;This movie got me grinning .;3
1695;1696;35934;Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .;0
1276;1277;27804;A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .;0
1580;1581;33677;Certainly the performances are worthwhile .;3
1419;1420;30559;Nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil .;4

1966;1967;41019;Though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed .;2
1496;1497;31982;A simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm .;4
1707;1708;36157;A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .;2
2098;2099;43397;The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .;1

2047;2048;42478;Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .;0

1153;1154;25261;The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .;2
1275;1276;27776;All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .;1

2023;2024;42046;An energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it is n't .;3
2012;2013;41812;It picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film .;4

1851;1852;38827;Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .;2
1173;1174;25701;One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .;4
1381;1382;29800;It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .;1
1817;1818;38220;And people make fun of me for liking Showgirls .;1
1988;1989;41380;Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .;4

1389;1390;29972;Like any good romance , Son of the Bride , proves it 's never too late to learn .;3
1349;1350;29168;This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .;1

1461;1462;31299;Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .;0
1538;1539;32847;The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .;3

1417;1418;30524;And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .;1
1993;1994;41461;A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .;0
1720;1721;36393;Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .;0
1943;1944;40589;It is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter .;4
1075;1076;23682;Jagger , Stoppard and director Michael Apted ... deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride .;4

1576;1577;33596;Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .;4
1786;1787;37597;Clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up .;1
1543;1544;32947;As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .;0

2092;2093;43308;Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .;3
1612;1613;34360;Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs .;4
1504;1505;32127;A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .;1
1643;1644;34935;A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded Elvis fans -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- will have fun with .;4
1515;1516;32341;It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .;3

1662;1663;35373;The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .;1
1345;1346;29059;Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .;1

1359;1360;29348;After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .;0

3041;3044;60269;Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .;2
2565;2566;52015;Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .;0
2923;2926;58070;Fulfills the minimum requirement of Disney animation .;2

3161;3164;62547;Beautifully crafted and brutally honest , Promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the Middle East struggle and into the humanity of its people .;4
2439;2440;49738;Combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration .;3
2256;2257;46404;Stanley Kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe .;4

2808;2811;56114;In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .;1
2155;2156;44481;A uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot .;3

2306;2307;47318;But it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one .;3
2934;2937;58264;Begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .;4
2304;2305;47288;Those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .;1

3121;3124;61800;The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .;1

2532;2533;51436;The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .;0
2516;2517;51137;The limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie .;2
2798;2801;55997;The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .;1

2161;2162;44616;A beautiful , entertaining two hours .;4

2765;2768;55454;It wo n't harm anyone , but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it .;2
3170;3173;62747;A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .;1
2735;2737;54934;Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .;2
2565;2566;52015;Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .;0
2774;2777;55610;A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .;0
2787;2790;55792;... hypnotically dull .;0
2635;2637;53156;It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny .;4
2180;2181;44950;Not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but Coppola , along with his sister , Sofia , is a real filmmaker .;3
2920;2923;57992;It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .;2
2743;2745;55072;Pull -LRB- s -RRB- off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel .;2
2294;2295;47048;Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?;0
2592;2593;52411;With a cast of A-list Brit actors , it is worth searching out .;4

2397;2398;49089;An intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality .;3
2922;2925;58054;The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .;0
3103;3106;61450;Enticing and often funny documentary .;4
3033;3036;60180;Even more baffling is that it 's funny .;2

3079;3082;60988;Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .;1

2217;2218;45627;This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .;0
3065;3068;60737;A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .;1
2535;2536;51504;A no-holds-barred cinematic treat .;4

2318;2319;47559;Methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , Secret Ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain .;4

2652;2654;53530;Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .;0
2812;2815;56168;Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .;0
2382;2383;48792;A rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending .;4
2595;2596;52450;It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .;4

3069;3072;60842;That rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film .;4

2698;2700;54319;A well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity .;3
2945;2948;58495;A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .;0

2874;2877;57116;Take Care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length .;1

2663;2665;53687;Its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story .;3

2961;2964;58778;The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels;4
2986;2989;59222;... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .;0
2942;2945;58439;The catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .;0
2181;2182;44976;Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .;1

3180;3183;62895;... a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh .;4
3093;3096;61245;It provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1.2 million Palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of Gaza .;2

2839;2842;56588;In The New Guy , even the bull gets recycled .;1
2356;2357;48280;Peppering this urban study with references to Norwegian folktales , Villeneuve creates in Maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical .;3
2311;2312;47429;For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .;1

3001;3004;59557;What soured me on The Santa Clause 2 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky .;0
2605;2606;52609;The actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers do n't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .;2
2317;2318;47551;Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .;3
2303;2304;47270;Jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness .;4
2558;2559;51865;Jacquot 's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself .;3
2730;2732;54853;But fans of the show should not consider this a diss .;2
2903;2906;57619;All right , so it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny -LRB- sometimes hilarious -RRB- comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast .;3
2691;2693;54215;The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .;2

2329;2330;47800;Deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance .;3
2430;2431;49610;This sort of cute and cloying material is far from Zhang 's forte and it shows .;2
2819;2822;56282;A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling .;4
2815;2818;56221;There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .;1

2611;2612;52734;-LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .;3
2869;2872;57038;The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .;3
2662;2664;53653;Although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .;1
2797;2800;55975;Sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before .;3
3023;3026;59969;a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite .;3
2193;2194;45163;Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .;1
2312;2313;47463;The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .;4
3088;3091;61164;... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ...;4
3105;3108;61480;Here 's my advice , Kev .;2
3053;3056;60524;A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .;0
2691;2693;54215;The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .;2
3055;3058;60561;Young Everlyn Sampi , as the courageous Molly Craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film .;4
2228;2229;45823;The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .;3
2411;2412;49292;Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...;1

2599;2600;52523;The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful .;2
2929;2932;58160;Combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that 's not merely about kicking undead \*\*\* , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption .;4
2548;2549;51698;What redeems the film is the cast , particularly the Ya-Yas themselves .;3
2715;2717;54608;Fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .;4
2795;2798;55947;It 's Pauly Shore awful .;0
2383;2384;48829;Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .;0
2418;2419;49406;A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .;2
2381;2382;48782;Sure , I hated myself in the morning .;1
2318;2319;47559;Methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , Secret Ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain .;4
2999;3002;59528;Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .;1
2674;2676;53907;It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up .;3
2368;2369;48478;This is DiCaprio 's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year .;4
2582;2583;52267;Every child 's story is what matters .;2
2886;2889;57320;Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .;3
3190;3193;63152;The bland outweighs the nifty , and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .;2
2528;2529;51353;This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .;0
2950;2953;58606;For those in search of something different , Wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale .;3
2710;2712;54553;She allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly .;3
2178;2179;44923;The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock .;2
2864;2867;56979;Affable if not timeless , Like Mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids .;3
2160;2161;44597;The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .;1
3144;3147;62245;The directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on Taylor 's doorstep .;0
2229;2230;45840;Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .;0
2211;2212;45499;Rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , Jiang Wen 's Devils on the Doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut .;4
2855;2858;56840;` You 'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied .;2
2549;2550;51709;The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .;0
3176;3179;62809;A fine , rousing , G-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats .;4
2911;2914;57830;it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart;2
3053;3056;60524;A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .;0
2167;2168;44710;A giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say .;3
2268;2269;46623;In a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that Secret Ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .;3

2627;2629;53017;-LRB- Davis -RRB- wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .;1
3180;3183;62895;... a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh .;4
2503;2504;50879;It 's a masterpeice .;4
2215;2216;45600;Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .;1
2700;2702;54372;A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .;2
3193;3196;63204;Otto-Sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye .;3
2362;2363;48389;Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .;1
3127;3130;61883;Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances ... keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease .;3
2404;2405;49205;By-the-numbers yarn .;1
2842;2845;56635;The script is smart , not cloying .;3

2785;2788;55736;Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .;1
2333;2334;47864;A visionary marvel , but it 's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this .;1
2400;2401;49138;An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them .;4
2161;2162;44616;A beautiful , entertaining two hours .;4
2964;2967;58846;is a mess .;0
3143;3146;62226;We have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting .;2
2233;2234;45927;The Porky 's Revenge : Ultimate Edition ?;2
2179;2180;44938;Speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life .;4
2219;2220;45676;Witty , vibrant , and intelligent .;3
2435;2436;49668;There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .;1
3112;3115;61625;There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch .;4
2643;2645;53279;The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .;1
2369;2370;48496;Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .;1
2231;2232;45882;A creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man ... about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy .;3
2256;2257;46404;Stanley Kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe .;4
2648;2650;53438;A plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of ` home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households .;3
3082;3085;61073;Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .;1
2387;2388;48895;As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .;0
2822;2825;56345;This is a film living far too much in its own head .;1
2986;2989;59222;... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .;0
3161;3164;62547;Beautifully crafted and brutally honest , Promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the Middle East struggle and into the humanity of its people .;4
2496;2497;50758;Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .;1
2244;2245;46130;A sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect .;3
2802;2805;56065;The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .;1
2447;2448;49884;Nelson 's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself .;1
3038;3041;60235;It 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie .;3
3150;3153;62355;Blade II is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she 's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time .;2
3591;3594;70460;Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .;1
3870;3873;75521;This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .;2
3239;3242;64073;In XXX , Diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep .;4
3260;3263;64441;This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .;2
4248;4252;82359;Family fare .;3
3553;3556;69913;Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter .;2
3395;3398;66945;If Borstal Boy is n't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece .;2
3624;3627;71090;The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .;0
3775;3778;73854;We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .;0
3649;3652;71574;The most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from Portugal .;3
4111;4115;79864;This fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives The Lady and the Duke something of a theatrical air .;3
3233;3236;63957;There are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .;2
4031;4034;78432;If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .;0
4076;4080;79218;Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King .;1
3859;3862;75266;It has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect .;4
4034;4037;78472;The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in .;2
3597;3600;70614;"A thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action .";2
3512;3515;69174;The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .;0
3645;3648;71516;It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .;1
3779;3782;73947;It has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and Mandy Moore leaves a positive impression .;3
3307;3310;65379;Extremely bad .;0
3669;3672;71914;And the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him .;3
3454;3457;68115;I found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as Vincent became more and more abhorrent .;1
3420;3423;67450;I liked it just enough .;3
3346;3349;66007;... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . ';1
3627;3630;71127;Worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees .;3
4204;4208;81589;All in all , Brown Sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted .;4
3380;3383;66626;Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .;0
3753;3756;73488;Silly , loud and goofy .;2
3274;3277;64712;Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie : Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .;1
3736;3739;73216;As it is , it 's too long and unfocused .;0
4028;4031;78335;This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers .;2
3280;3283;64822;A culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling American in Europe .;3
3975;3978;77336;It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .;4
3236;3239;64032;A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .;0
3567;3570;70097;An estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote -LRB- and cannier doppelganger -RRB- to Diesel 's XXX flex-a-thon .;2
3254;3257;64339;But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences;0
3504;3507;69031;Not since Ghostbusters has a film used Manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .;4
3760;3763;73585;Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .;1
3539;3542;69646;Patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .;1
3918;3921;76331;Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .;2
3653;3656;71646;Sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative .;3
3701;3704;72488;What sets Ms. Birot 's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents .;3

3748;3751;73384;It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .;0
3452;3455;68083;A dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .;0
3933;3936;76547;A preposterous , prurient whodunit .;0
3532;3535;69545;Mr. Spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned .;3
3295;3298;65172;An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .;0

3867;3870;75489;... a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of Mamet .;4
3236;3239;64032;A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .;0
4128;4132;80191;Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .;1
3308;3311;65381;The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .;0
3841;3844;74962;the phone rings and a voice tells you you 've got seven days left to live .;2
3594;3597;70561;While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .;2
3894;3897;75949;This u-boat does n't have a captain .;1
3399;3402;67018;Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on;0
3493;3496;68829;Captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head .;4
3686;3689;72205;displays the potential for a better movie than what Bailly manages to deliver;2
3604;3607;70755;As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .;0
3432;3435;67636;I do n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 Paradiso will prefer this new version .;1
3377;3380;66600;And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .;0
4142;4146;80503;A dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation .;4
3734;3737;73169;Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .;0
3643;3646;71482;A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .;1
4019;4022;78150;As warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .;4
4165;4169;80870;I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .;0
3476;3479;68541;Gangster No. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .;4
4060;4064;78981;As directed by Dani Kouyate of Burkina Faso , Sia lacks visual flair .;2
4245;4249;82298;One of the best films I have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense .;3
3583;3586;70346;Functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing .;3
3395;3398;66945;If Borstal Boy is n't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece .;2
3215;3218;63569;Absolutely not .;1
3514;3517;69207;As giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago .;4
3428;3431;67601;There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .;0
4259;4263;82568;A much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director Anthony Friedman 's similarly updated 1970 British production .;3
3646;3649;71526;The Importance of Being Earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play . '';1
3538;3541;69638;An enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race .;3
4207;4211;81621;A beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder .;4
3684;3687;72169;It zips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special .;4
4132;4136;80235;It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .;0
3368;3371;66421;There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .;0
3871;3874;75562;What could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking .;4
4096;4100;79636;It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .;2
3350;3353;66094;Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .;0
4214;4218;81766;A hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic French nuance .;2
3511;3514;69144;Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .;1
4178;4182;81165;But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .;2
3665;3668;71869;Eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath .;2
4166;4170;80889;Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .;0

3671;3674;71946;Please see previous answer .;2
4157;4161;80748;Do n't even bother to rent this on video .;0
3811;3814;74415;What lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .;3
3283;3286;64902;On a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .;0
3541;3544;69677;An impeccable study in perversity .;3
3343;3346;65969;Even the digressions are funny .;3
3854;3857;75193;For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .;0
4191;4195;81391;Strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .;3
4177;4181;81160;Duvall is strong as always .;4
4173;4177;81046;The modern remake of Dumas 's story is long on narrative and -LRB- too -RRB- short on action .;1
3763;3766;73628;It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .;0
3691;3694;72266;It 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom .;3
3595;3598;70584;Knows how to make our imagination wonder .;4
3322;3325;65603;Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .;0
3540;3543;69661;Trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the `` Gadzooks ! '';1
3393;3396;66917;Enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary .;4
3456;3459;68140;Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder .;1
3729;3732;73058;Although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another Major League .;1
3744;3747;73324;An ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre .;3
3415;3418;67352;It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf .;1
3909;3912;76239;Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .;1
4055;4059;78866;The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .;0
3847;3850;75075;A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .;1
3434;3437;67683;Adam Sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt;1
3276;3279;64748;A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .;1
3450;3453;68055;Norton is magnetic as Graham .;3
4239;4243;82225;You could put it on a coffee table anywhere .;2
3512;3515;69174;The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .;0
3838;3841;74913;When you 've got the wildly popular Vin Diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed .;3
3373;3376;66513;Klein , charming in comedies like American Pie and dead-on in Election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .;1
4027;4030;78321;But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .;1
3278;3281;64789;Contrived as this may sound , Mr. Rose 's updating works surprisingly well .;3
4109;4113;79818;It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .;1
3858;3861;75256;A comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising .;4
3755;3758;73530;A moving and important film .;4
3556;3559;69948;There 's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side .;2
3718;3721;72859;He nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race .;4
3537;3540;69616;The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .;1
3481;3484;68620;Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .;1
3690;3693;72244;Showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation .;4
4121;4125;80069;In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .;0
3284;3287;64928;Colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , Burkinabe filmmaker Dani Kouyate 's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .;2
3223;3226;63703;High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .;1
4033;4036;78470;An intoxicating experience .;4
3534;3537;69569;Kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope .;3
3988;3991;77585;Payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle America and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human .;3
3756;3759;73534;You wo n't exactly know what 's happening but you 'll be blissfully exhausted .;2
4037;4040;78533;If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .;2
3501;3504;68993;A chilling movie without oppressive gore .;3
4052;4056;78808;This is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style .;4
3439;3442;67769;Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .;1
3798;3801;74181;One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .;0
3433;3436;67651;Whether or not you 're enlightened by any of Derrida 's lectures on `` the other '' and `` the self , '' Derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow .;4
4075;4079;79192;Working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by Gianni Romoli ... Ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up .;4
3392;3395;66895;Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .;2
4032;4035;78454;When one hears Harry Shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best;3
3638;3641;71371;"About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .";1
3884;3887;75800;The rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it 's based .;4
3962;3965;77063;` CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about;1
4099;4103;79685;Seen in that light , Moonlight Mile should strike a nerve in many .;3
3590;3593;70454;Works as pretty contagious fun .;4
3597;3600;70614;"A thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action .";2
3994;3997;77713;It 's something of the ultimate Scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful New York gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas .;4
3613;3616;70929;The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .;3
3546;3549;69777;By the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better .;2
4200;4204;81505;Broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed .;3
3755;3758;73530;A moving and important film .;4
3400;3403;67029;Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .;0
3568;3571;70121;I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .;1
4129;4133;80199;With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams , the Spy Kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a James Bond series for kids .;3
3738;3741;73244;When the heroes were actually under 40 ?;2
3467;3470;68375;The genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates .;4
3622;3625;71071;A half-assed film .;0
4155;4159;80733;There 's lots of cool stuff packed into ESPN 's Ultimate X.;3
3475;3478;68527;Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .;0
3577;3580;70297;Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .;2

3961;3964;77055;Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .;1
3578;3581;70302;Dramatically lackluster .;0

4174;4178;81064;Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .;2
3640;3643;71428;Red Dragon makes one appreciate Silence of the Lambs .;2
4056;4060;78900;After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .;0
3802;3805;74274;This overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious .;1
3851;3854;75157;Though not for everyone , The Guys is a somber trip worth taking .;2
3394;3397;66924;I 'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes .;2
3825;3828;74651;Tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother .;3
3685;3688;72189;An uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from American cinema .;3
3449;3452;68010;Others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find Morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .;4
3444;3447;67892;A movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well .;3
3318;3321;65557;The thing about guys like Evans is this : You 're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins .;1
3322;3325;65603;Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .;0
3865;3868;75433;No matter how firmly director John Stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .;2
3648;3651;71553;A much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian English title would have you believe .;4
3403;3406;67102;... manages to fall closer in quality to Silence than to the abysmal Hannibal .;2
3950;3953;76863;Boldly engineering a collision between tawdry B-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , Rose 's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer .;2
3502;3505;68999;What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate .;1
3374;3377;66542;Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .;2
3976;3979;77354;The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .;0
3423;3426;67474;The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .;0
4150;4154;80664;Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in New York .;1
3774;3777;73820;I 'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of Woolf and Clarissa Dalloway , The Hours represents two of those well spent .;3
4257;4261;82525;Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .;0
3242;3245;64133;With or without ballast tanks , K-19 sinks to a Harrison Ford low .;1
3899;3902;76035;Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs .;2
3300;3303;65254;They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book .;1

4138;4142;80383;Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .;1
3569;3572;70152;What we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .;1
3327;3330;65705;Technically and artistically inept .;1
3852;3855;75167;Top-notch action powers this romantic drama .;4
3244;3247;64170;A surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy .;3
3978;3981;77393;Frank McKlusky C.I. is that movie !;2
3570;3573;70165;A movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting than by its own story .;2
4020;4023;78181;It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .;0
3976;3979;77354;The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .;0
3872;3875;75584;Return to Never Land is reliable , standard Disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages .;4
3460;3463;68200;While this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it 's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience .;2
4021;4024;78204;The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there 's not enough to the story to fill two hours .;2
3362;3365;66339;An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .;1

3358;3361;66279;This off-putting French romantic comedy;1
3365;3368;66386;I 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and I recommend it for its originality alone .;4

3731;3734;73085;Mama Africa pretty much delivers on that promise .;3
3332;3335;65784;This is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous .;2

3908;3911;76214;As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .;0
3217;3220;63606;The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .;1

3473;3476;68504;Overall , it 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : God is love .;4
3694;3697;72339;Crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy .;3

3946;3949;76778;Try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of Kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment .;4
3341;3344;65926;It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .;1
3862;3865;75344;Worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film .;3
3565;3568;70068;Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .;1
4164;4168;80855;This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .;1
3866;3869;75459;Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .;0

3468;3471;68394;Even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough .;2
3489;3492;68729;It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .;2
3449;3452;68010;Others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find Morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .;4
4204;4208;81589;All in all , Brown Sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted .;4
3877;3880;75680;Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .;2

3451;3454;68061;Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .;1
4144;4148;80524;A frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it 's a tougher picture than it is .;2
4020;4023;78181;It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .;0

3386;3389;66783;But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .;1
3270;3273;64653;One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .;1

4256;4260;82508;The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson ...;4
3258;3261;64410;A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .;2
3562;3565;70020;I found The Ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .;3
3600;3603;70673;Stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid .;4

3803;3806;74292;Fulford-Wierzbicki ... deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen .;3
4214;4218;81766;A hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic French nuance .;2

4152;4156;80681;An unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture .;3
4182;4186;81222;Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .;1
3804;3807;74301;This is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it 's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men .;3
4193;4197;81404;An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .;2
4246;4250;82325;Like these Russo guys lookin ' for their Mamet instead found their Sturges .;2
3506;3509;69095;Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .;0
3835;3838;74858;The movie 's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing .;3
3829;3832;74742;Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .;1
3458;3461;68176;The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .;1
4139;4143;80405;It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more .;4
3999;4002;77814;Strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency .;3
3629;3632;71172;Because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin .;4
3960;3963;77042;A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .;0
3632;3635;71219;"The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .";0
4263;4267;82637;This makes Minority Report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever .;4

3520;3523;69283;Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .;1
4043;4047;78630;A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .;1
3806;3809;74339;While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .;1

3795;3798;74147;Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .;1
3500;3503;68959;Despite Besson 's high-profile name being Wasabi 's big selling point , there is no doubt that Krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film 's thoroughly winning tone .;3

3382;3385;66694;Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .;0
3551;3554;69881;On its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny .;3

3748;3751;73384;It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .;0

4236;4240;82164;A rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means .;3

3374;3377;66542;Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .;2

3981;3984;77441;Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .;1

3661;3664;71807;Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .;1
3609;3612;70855;The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .;2
3293;3296;65145;A bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale .;3

4217;4221;81791;Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .;1
4057;4061;78919;It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .;2
3286;3289;64979;Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .;1
4127;4131;80176;Is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief .;4

3822;3825;74591;A fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .;4
3505;3508;69047;It 's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .;3

3258;3261;64410;A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .;2

4260;4264;82591;Writer-director David Jacobson and his star , Jeremy Renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .;4
3308;3311;65381;The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .;0
4013;4016;78013;A visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .;1

3742;3745;73311;This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .;0
3326;3329;65676;All comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad .;0

4151;4155;80679;A well-crafted letdown .;1
4001;4004;77862;Delight your senses and crash this wedding !;4
3987;3990;77571;Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .;0
3315;3318;65514;Ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills .;0
4039;4042;78578;The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .;1
3971;3974;77244;The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . '';0
3641;3644;71434;Made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because -LRB- Solondz 's -RRB- cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .;2

3544;3547;69749;Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .;0
3216;3219;63571;The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose .;1

4257;4261;82525;Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .;0
3863;3866;75358;Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .;0

3542;3545;69683;Open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , Talk to Her is a cinephile 's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations .;2
4250;4254;82366;But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .;1

3872;3875;75584;Return to Never Land is reliable , standard Disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages .;4

3282;3285;64875;What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -LRB- dark green , to be exact -RRB- , sour , bloody and mean .;1
3602;3605;70735;Birthday Girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked .;4
3273;3276;64699;The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .;1
3288;3291;65022;This rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .;3
3959;3962;77026;I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .;1
3391;3394;66886;By that measure , it is a failure .;0

3946;3949;76778;Try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of Kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment .;4
3861;3864;75315;Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .;1
4208;4212;81638;The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .;2
3297;3300;65192;... while Dark Water is n't a complete wash -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- , watched side-by-side with Ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor .;1
4139;4143;80405;It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more .;4
3967;3970;77167;Full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , Time Out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life .;1
3339;3342;65886;What might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .;1
3334;3337;65809;Matters play out realistically if not always fairly .;3
3812;3815;74450;Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .;4
3944;3947;76745;Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .;0
4213;4217;81733;The movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , Rocky-like moments ... but it 's such a warm and charming package that you 'll feel too happy to argue much .;2
3411;3414;67279;Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .;1
4206;4210;81617;It 's about time .;2
4093;4097;79582;The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .;1
4021;4024;78204;The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there 's not enough to the story to fill two hours .;2
4226;4230;81989;A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .;1
3635;3638;71312;A powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution .;3
3900;3903;76061;The main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .;1
3476;3479;68541;Gangster No. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .;4
3472;3475;68496;Sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .;4
3509;3512;69116;As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .;3
3902;3905;76107;The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .;0
3766;3769;73689;This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .;0
4141;4145;80458;If S&M seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's -LRB- and its makers ' -RRB- credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves .;3
3819;3822;74551;Expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished .;2
3647;3650;71544;The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .;0

3251;3254;64284;A stylish thriller .;4
3249;3252;64245;It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn .;4
3524;3527;69371;... an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller .;4
3898;3901;76027;I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .;1
3625;3628;71100;Smart and alert , Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is a small gem .;3
3361;3364;66316;As banal as the telling may be -- and at times , All My Loved Ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention .;3
3970;3973;77227;Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .;1
3718;3721;72859;He nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race .;4
4174;4178;81064;Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .;2
3407;3410;67196;Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond Road Warrior , it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .;3
3459;3462;68186;He has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper .;3
3740;3743;73266;A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .;0
4190;4194;81370;The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .;2
3655;3658;71694;The Christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it;1
3810;3813;74399;Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .;2
4122;4126;80081;Try as you might to resist , if you 've got a place in your heart for Smokey Robinson , this movie will worm its way there .;3
4078;4082;79266;The film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant .;4
3284;3287;64928;Colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , Burkinabe filmmaker Dani Kouyate 's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .;2
3221;3224;63670;Although What Time offers Tsai 's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films .;4
4090;4094;79500;It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .;1
3237;3240;64040;This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .;0
3969;3972;77213;`` Punch-Drunk Love '' is a little like a chocolate milk moustache ...;2

3771;3774;73780;We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .;1

4120;4124;80028;In capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .;2

3491;3494;68785;Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .;1
4158;4162;80755;In addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- Lilo & Stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .;4
4186;4190;81271;They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .;0

5200;5206;99270;The photographer 's show-don ` t-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .;2
4273;4277;82816;To paraphrase a line from another Dickens ' novel , Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .;0
4739;4744;91190;This gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family .;4
4379;4384;84752;It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .;3
5145;5151;98278;Her fans walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , '' but had so much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost .;0
4314;4318;83532;You wo n't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again .;2
4493;4498;86815;Austin Powers in Goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride .;1
5098;5104;97575;Are monsters born , or made ?;2
4807;4813;92421;Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears .;2
4669;4674;89812;Scooby Doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation .;4
5234;5240;99867;I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .;0
4319;4323;83635;An exhilarating serving of movie fluff .;2
5329;5335;101438;There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .;2
4699;4704;90388;Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .;1
4915;4921;94294;Dense , exhilarating documentary .;3
4850;4856;93185;Over and over again .;1
5267;5273;100515;Marinated;2
5247;5253;100110;A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .;0
5039;5045;96570;There are so few films about the plight of American Indians in modern America that Skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front .;3
5261;5267;100362;The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .;4
4371;4376;84578;A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .;0
5244;5250;100046;Though Nijinsky 's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .;3
5212;5218;99501;A highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world .;2
4479;4484;86592;The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? ';2
4665;4670;89735;A first-class , thoroughly involving B movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film .;4
5192;5198;99091;Eric Schweig and Graham Greene both exude an air of dignity that 's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters .;4
5067;5073;97058;The camera twirls !;2
4346;4350;84194;But this is Lohman 's film .;2
4455;4460;86164;Worth seeing just for Weaver and LaPaglia .;3
4625;4630;89069;It 's just plain boring .;2
5147;5153;98314;You Should Pay Nine Bucks for This : Because you can hear about suffering Afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected .;2
4360;4364;84384;Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .;0
5066;5072;97036;A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .;1
5159;5165;98521;Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .;2
5121;5127;97907;It 's no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke .;4
4941;4947;94843;Insufferably naive .;1
5057;5063;96860;Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .;1
4556;4561;87801;With each of her three protagonists , Miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path .;4
4347;4351;84200;If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .;0
5038;5044;96550;contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II;1
4784;4790;92039;A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .;1
5310;5316;101154;Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .;1
4944;4950;94862;Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .;0
4352;4356;84290;The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .;1
4266;4270;82697;This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .;0
5129;5135;98008;This is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light -LRB- yet unsentimental -RRB- touch .;3
5221;5227;99634;Rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling Hollywood style -- casting excellent Latin actors of all ages -- a trend long overdue .;3
4904;4910;94103;It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .;0
5058;5064;96873;s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance .;2
5215;5221;99557;may prove to be -LRB- Tsai 's -RRB- masterpiece .;4
4960;4966;95198;A directorial tour de force by Bernard Rose , ivans xtc .;3
5316;5322;101233;It 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental .;2
4691;4696;90217;Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .;1
4545;4550;87617;Ali 's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier .;2
4420;4425;85562;Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me .;1
4340;4344;84094;Straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , Possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it .;3
4551;4556;87747;There 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence .;3
4817;4823;92576;Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .;0
4944;4950;94862;Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .;0
4818;4824;92584;Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .;1
4488;4493;86718;Nohe 's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : He is n't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction .;3
4725;4730;90911;It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy .;1
5306;5312;101092;He fails .;1
4324;4328;83727;... Pray does n't have a passion for the material .;1
5046;5052;96724;It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .;0
4317;4321;83619;Chances are you wo n't , either .;2
4475;4480;86502;While Glover , the irrepressible eccentric of River 's Edge , Dead Man and Back to the Future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents Bartleby 's main overall flaw .;2
4454;4459;86132;More of the same from Taiwanese auteur Tsai Ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who 's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films .;3
4937;4943;94729;Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild .;2
4514;4519;87119;A compelling pre-WWII drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message .;4
5031;5037;96429;But what is missing from it all is a moral .;1
5195;5201;99172;The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .;0
4375;4380;84643;A hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as Grant 's two best films -- Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones 's Diary .;4
4963;4969;95232;It tends to remind one of a really solid Woody Allen film , with its excellent use of New York locales and sharp writing;4
5041;5047;96620;While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .;3
5204;5210;99350;Weiss and Speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .;2
4600;4605;88628;It 's exactly the kind of movie Toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .;1
4428;4433;85701;What 's worse is that Pelosi knows it .;1
5165;5171;98638;It 's always enthralling .;4
4836;4842;92945;You 're not merely watching history , you 're engulfed by it .;4
5139;5145;98193;An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .;0
4326;4330;83752;The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .;1
4461;4466;86239;Suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands .;0
4676;4681;89943;High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .;3
4802;4808;92349;A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .;0
4275;4279;82865;Like its predecessor , it 's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate .;2
4744;4749;91263;The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again .;0
5224;5230;99689;"Clayburgh and Tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves Eric Schaeffer .";2
4330;4334;83862;It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout .;3
5153;5159;98420;While it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight .;3
4693;4698;90261;The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .;4
4439;4444;85861;Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .;1
5199;5205;99246;Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .;4
4639;4644;89332;Even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it does n't make for completely empty entertainment;2
4273;4277;82816;To paraphrase a line from another Dickens ' novel , Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .;0
4596;4601;88560;Both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right .;4
5230;5236;99796;A marvel of production design .;4
4413;4418;85417;An often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century .;3
4704;4709;90463;The story ... is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is .;4
4951;4957;95027;A droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the Lone Star State .;1
4918;4924;94353;Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .;0
4568;4573;88030;Whereas Oliver Stone 's conspiracy thriller JFK was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , Interview with the Assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity .;3
4749;4754;91391;The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .;0
4646;4651;89459;A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .;1
4470;4475;86442;The sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film .;3
5135;5141;98123;... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .;0
5271;5277;100558;Before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway .;1
4510;4515;87069;A weird and wonderful comedy .;4
4788;4794;92108;Ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of Chinese ` cultural revolution . ';3
4782;4788;92009;` Enigma ' is the kind of engaging historical drama that Hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of ` We Were Soldiers . ';2
4767;4773;91712;Where This was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , That is even lazier and far less enjoyable .;1
4634;4639;89241;The picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came .;3
4558;4563;87836;There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -LRB- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -RRB- , but `` Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .;4
5250;5256;100172;A fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame Americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with Kissinger .;4
5102;5108;97624;A superlative B movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing .;3
5179;5185;98851;The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .;0
4620;4625;89000;Its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads .;4
4755;4760;91487;It reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death .;3
5103;5109;97633;It did n't go straight to video .;2
4741;4746;91222;It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .;1
4553;4558;87770;Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .;0
4394;4399;85037;By turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , Never Again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre .;4
5323;5329;101380;An enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment .;3
4638;4643;89308;-LRB- Garbus -RRB- discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .;2
5203;5209;99324;Despite its shortcomings , Girls Ca n't Swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it 's a worthy entry in the French coming-of-age genre .;3
4495;4500;86855;It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .;3
4452;4457;86101;... Myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-Tarantino pop-culture riffs ...;2
5024;5030;96313;Fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough .;4
5012;5018;96059;A sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really is n't .;3
4537;4542;87522;"Despite Hoffman 's best efforts , Wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before .";2
5053;5059;96829;Cynics need not apply . ';2
5015;5021;96126;The movie is a dud .;0
4620;4625;89000;Its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads .;4
4594;4599;88498;A lovely film ... elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic ... hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source 's complexity .;4
4489;4494;86750;A film of ideas and wry comic mayhem .;3
5278;5284;100641;It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like .;2
4650;4655;89515;Hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ?;0
5128;5134;98003;Leigh makes these lives count .;3
5138;5144;98159;An old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher 's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue .;3
5292;5298;100858;With elements cribbed from Lang 's Metropolis , Welles ' Kane , and Eisenstein 's Potemkin;1
4850;4856;93185;Over and over again .;1
4685;4690;90097;If not a home run , then at least a solid base hit .;3
4832;4838;92880;The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .;0
4645;4650;89441;You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .;0
5090;5096;97426;Alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life .;3
5256;5262;100274;It is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .;3
4612;4617;88866;Same guy with both hats .;2
4820;4826;92626;A big-budget\/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as The Hours is a distinct rarity , and an event .;3
4596;4601;88560;Both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right .;4
4727;4732;90967;It 's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters .;4
5171;5177;98701;It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .;0
4295;4299;83253;The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .;1
4769;4775;91761;So-so entertainment .;2
4785;4791;92056;Idiotic and ugly .;0
4979;4985;95429;True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .;0
4607;4612;88759;This odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in Morton 's ever-watchful gaze -- and it 's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .;4
5002;5008;95841;If you go , pack your knitting needles .;0
5178;5184;98837;Some Body will take you places you have n't been , and also places you have .;3
4374;4379;84624;Sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they 'd need a shower .;0
4702;4707;90428;What little grace -LRB- Rifkin 's -RRB- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .;1
4472;4477;86463;Finally , the French-produced `` Read My Lips '' is a movie that understands characters must come first .;3
4306;4310;83416;While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's Animal House .;2
4385;4390;84883;Jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting .;2
4515;4520;87132;If there 's one big point to Promises , it 's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other .;2
4546;4551;87642;There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure .;4
4955;4961;95118;... pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .;0
5253;5259;100228;Could I have been more geeked when I heard that Apollo 13 was going to be released in IMAX format ?;4
4608;4613;88802;Contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .;1
4434;4439;85794;Ferrara 's strongest and most touching movie of recent years .;4
5118;5124;97866;Feeble comedy .;1
5181;5187;98880;Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .;1
5326;5332;101396;A brutal and funny work .;4
4924;4930;94442;"It 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from .";2
4285;4289;83100;To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .;0
4656;4661;89612;Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .;2
4832;4838;92880;The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .;0
5179;5185;98851;The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .;0
4585;4590;88364;A serious movie with serious ideas .;4
4415;4420;85455;Every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat .;4
4710;4715;90571;The movie 's seams may show ... but Pellington gives `` Mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .;3
5095;5101;97539;Features Fincher 's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity .;3
4750;4755;91402;Featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .;3
4859;4865;93287;That death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world 's religions .;2
5047;5053;96748;Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone .;2
5072;5078;97132;Hate it because it 's lousy .;0
4671;4676;89842;Recoing 's fantastic performance does n't exactly reveal what makes Vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat .;2
4995;5001;95734;While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .;1
4272;4276;82791;Watching War Photographer , you come to believe that Nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals .;3
5130;5136;98030;Meant to reduce Blake 's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator Todd McFarlane 's superhero dystopia .;2

4709;4714;90548;A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .;0

4932;4938;94605;Insanely hilarious !;4
4761;4767;91624;Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .;0

5011;5017;96026;You may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by Argentine director Fabian Bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet .;1
4269;4273;82728;The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .;2
5054;5060;96833;An involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings .;2

5161;5167;98597;Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !;4
4510;4515;87069;A weird and wonderful comedy .;4
4665;4670;89735;A first-class , thoroughly involving B movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film .;4
5236;5242;99919;Ozpetek 's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie .;4
4852;4858;93194;It 's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .;2
4872;4878;93546;If you 've the patience , there are great rewards here .;3
4550;4555;87713;The screenplay never lets us forget that Bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him ... There is never really a true `` us '' versus `` them '' .;3
5014;5020;96087;-LRB- Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are -RRB- sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .;1
4604;4609;88716;The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?;1
5013;5019;96082;A major waste ... generic .;0
5175;5181;98787;Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .;1
4969;4975;95307;The film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on Saturday morning TV especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand .;4
4993;4999;95705;Secret Ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving .;4

4863;4869;93359;Amy and Matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it .;3
4441;4446;85906;Not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially San Francisco lovers -- it 's a spirited film and a must-see .;3
5065;5071;97000;` it 's better to go in knowing full well what 's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists .;3
4793;4799;92214;Cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer .;3
5226;5232;99718;It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .;0
4320;4324;83641;The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .;0

4569;4574;88058;I can analyze this movie in three words : Thumbs Friggin ' Down .;0
4869;4875;93494;An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .;1
4341;4345;84121;Performances are potent , and the women 's stories are ably intercut and involving .;2
4921;4927;94405;A noble failure .;1
4355;4359;84343;Eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , Caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .;2
4651;4656;89535;All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .;1
5268;5274;100518;A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .;4
4398;4403;85129;An undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band .;3
4828;4834;92805;It 's stylishly directed with verve ...;3
5208;5214;99439;There is nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a - thousand-times - before movie .;0
4453;4458;86124;Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .;2
4757;4763;91511;An emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do .;4
4619;4624;88979;I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .;1
4437;4442;85831;By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .;3
5063;5069;96980;A lack of thesis makes Maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .;2
5176;5182;98800;Like Showgirls and Glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .;1
4989;4995;95641;Extraordinary debut from Josh Koury .;4
4414;4419;85437;For his first attempt at film noir , Spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future .;3
4647;4652;89477;There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .;1
4912;4918;94227;Playfully profound ... and crazier than Michael Jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows .;3
4752;4757;91445;Able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history .;3
5048;5054;96761;What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .;0
4560;4565;87894;Both heartbreaking and heartwarming ... just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving .;4
4825;4831;92731;As improbable as this premise may seem , Abbass 's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , Lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life .;4
4953;4959;95084;No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story .;1
5275;5281;100606;But seriously , folks , it does n't work .;1
4625;4630;89069;It 's just plain boring .;2
4627;4632;89089;While Parker and co-writer Catherine di Napoli are faithful to Melville 's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast ... have made the old boy 's characters more quick-witted than any English Lit major would have thought possible .;4
5268;5274;100518;A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .;4
5015;5021;96126;The movie is a dud .;0
4663;4668;89710;Late Marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love .;3
4426;4431;85682;Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .;0
5231;5237;99800;Nicole Holofcener 's Lovely and Amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style .;4
5226;5232;99718;It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .;0
4888;4894;93818;As plain and pedestrian as catsup --;0
4378;4383;84727;What makes this film special is Serry 's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context .;4
4971;4977;95343;Pascale Bailly 's rom-com;2
5008;5014;95965;Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ?;2
4362;4367;84422;This version of H.G. Wells ' Time Machine was directed by H.G. Wells ' great-grandson .;2
5074;5080;97164;Director Lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .;4
4397;4402;85101;Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .;2
5182;5188;98917;It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .;1
4404;4409;85274;Believability was n't one of the film 's virtues .;1
4933;4939;94607;There is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .;0
5255;5261;100269;... a confusing drudgery .;1
4986;4992;95587;About as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life .;2
4876;4882;93614;Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .;3
5036;5042;96502;It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .;2
5286;5292;100741;So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag .;1
5074;5080;97164;Director Lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .;4
4562;4567;87927;Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .;3
4909;4915;94170;There is a general air of exuberance in All About The Benjamins that 's hard to resist .;3
4747;4752;91348;` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .;2
5264;5270;100450;The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from Japan , the characters move with grace and panache .;4
4815;4821;92546;This new Time Machine is hardly perfect ... yet it proves surprisingly serviceable .;2
5218;5224;99587;If the movie were all comedy , it might work better .;2
4848;4854;93146;The Ya-Ya 's have many secrets and one is - the books are better .;0
4804;4810;92365;Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .;1
4421;4426;85583;The obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .;2
4677;4682;89969;Works because we 're never sure if Ohlinger 's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks .;2
5089;5095;97416;Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas .;1
4378;4383;84727;What makes this film special is Serry 's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context .;4
4540;4545;87566;These people are really going to love The Piano Teacher .;4
4372;4377;84598;It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .;0
4614;4619;88891;Unfortunately , neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .;2
4797;4803;92266;Cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of Those Days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie .;2
5100;5106;97604;A little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged .;3
5297;5303;100963;Murder by Numbers just does n't add up .;1
4558;4563;87836;There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -LRB- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -RRB- , but `` Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .;4
4383;4388;84838;Like an episode of MTV 's Undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance ... indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper .;2
4611;4616;88849;The film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence .;4
4559;4564;87886;And in a sense , that 's a liability .;1
4733;4738;91079;Watching this film , what we feel is n't mainly suspense or excitement .;1
4451;4456;86069;both overstuffed and undernourished ... The film ca n't be called a solid success , although there 's plenty of evidence here to indicate Clooney might have better luck next time .;2
4996;5002;95763;As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .;1
4410;4415;85376;It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .;1
5033;5039;96441;The film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .;3
4585;4590;88364;A serious movie with serious ideas .;4
4893;4899;93894;For devotees of French cinema , Safe Conduct is so rich with period minutiae it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven .;4
4886;4892;93793;It 's a fanboy ` what if ? ';2
4466;4471;86351;The work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them .;3
4695;4700;90281;Connoisseurs of Chinese film will be pleased to discover that Tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus .;3
4353;4357;84321;By the end you ca n't help but feel ` stoked . ';3
5220;5226;99609;There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .;2
4536;4541;87520;Thoroughly awful .;0
5214;5220;99546;Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .;0
4519;4524;87209;Sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .;2
5181;5187;98880;Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .;1
5025;5031;96323;Gives everyone something to shout about .;4
4532;4537;87448;The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .;1
4791;4797;92180;A surprisingly funny movie .;4
4572;4577;88117;The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .;0
5231;5237;99800;Nicole Holofcener 's Lovely and Amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style .;4

4891;4897;93864;When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?;1
4934;4940;94633;The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .;2
5106;5112;97658;This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .;0
5234;5240;99867;I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .;0
4844;4850;93075;I 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but;2
4768;4774;91736;I 'll put it this way : If you 're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you .;2
4390;4395;85005;has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs .;3
5082;5088;97308;It 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama .;4
4792;4798;92184;With not a lot of help from the screenplay -LRB- proficient , but singularly cursory -RRB- , -LRB- Testud -RRB- acts with the feral intensity of the young Bette Davis .;2
4269;4273;82728;The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .;2
4546;4551;87642;There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure .;4
4552;4557;87768;Does n't add up to much .;0
5190;5196;99062;`` It 's all about the image . '';2

5280;5286;100671;De Niro cries .;2

4715;4720;90663;Confessions is n't always coherent , but it 's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong .;3
4507;4512;87029;A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .;1
4783;4789;92036;An impressive hybrid .;4
5007;5013;95936;It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .;4
4402;4407;85225;Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring Ice-T in a major role .;3
4918;4924;94353;Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .;0
4505;4510;87001;One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .;0
5017;5023;96143;It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least .;3
4512;4517;87075;Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .;0
4967;4973;95271;Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .;1
4492;4497;86801;A gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable .;4
5196;5202;99197;One of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it 's far tamer than advertised .;3
4484;4489;86644;Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .;1
4447;4452;86039;Brisk hack job .;0
4879;4885;93677;A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .;0
4311;4315;83495;Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .;2
5245;5251;100071;The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .;0
5281;5287;100674;A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .;1
4790;4796;92159;Bad in such a bizarre way that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .;2
4438;4443;85842;Your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make .;2
4988;4994;95631;While the story 's undeniably hard to follow , Iwai 's gorgeous visuals seduce .;3

4549;4554;87695;Walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in Janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .;2
4415;4420;85455;Every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat .;4
4789;4795;92137;A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .;1
5020;5026;96203;It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .;1
4688;4693;90170;You 'll get the enjoyable basic minimum .;2
4597;4602;88569;Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso .;1
4580;4585;88274;Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .;1
4321;4325;83672;The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .;3
4431;4436;85751;The action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the Star Wars series .;3

4645;4650;89441;You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .;0
4289;4293;83156;Robin Williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of Bicentennial Man in favour of an altogether darker side .;3
5164;5170;98628;Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .;2

5261;5267;100362;The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .;4
4323;4327;83709;Goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse .;2

4669;4674;89812;Scooby Doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation .;4

5199;5205;99246;Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .;4
4571;4576;88108;The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .;1
4401;4406;85188;The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .;1

4573;4578;88132;The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years .;3

4882;4888;93732;Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .;2
4693;4698;90261;The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .;4
4393;4398;85028;I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .;0
4426;4431;85682;Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .;0
5134;5140;98112;A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .;1
4899;4905;94002;It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .;2
5007;5013;95936;It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .;4
5259;5265;100345;Mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully .;4
4798;4804;92295;It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .;0
5268;5274;100518;A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .;4

4375;4380;84643;A hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as Grant 's two best films -- Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones 's Diary .;4
4297;4301;83280;What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .;0
5319;5325;101313;Unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .;1
4910;4916;94183;There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling .;3
4802;4808;92349;A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .;0
4364;4369;84467;An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .;0

4658;4663;89627;Skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise .;4
4935;4941;94675;The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to Stonehenge .;0
5191;5197;99069;Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .;0

4870;4876;93515;After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .;0

5220;5226;99609;There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .;2
4345;4349;84185;Like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls .;3
4917;4923;94312;As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .;1
4658;4663;89627;Skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise .;4
4460;4465;86229;Watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy .;4
4842;4848;93040;Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .;1
4806;4812;92409;A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff .;1
5265;5271;100468;It strikes hardest ... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain .;3
4496;4501;86865;This is an interesting movie ! '';4
4672;4677;89867;It all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer .;1
4593;4598;88469;Though it 's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves .;1
5156;5162;98476;Nijinsky says , ' I know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too .;1

4737;4742;91160;Meyjes ' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil .;3
4670;4675;89831;Kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie .;4
4609;4614;88815;A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita .;1
4312;4316;83508;The big-screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison .;0
5228;5234;99771;Predictably melodramatic .;1
4940;4946;94803;Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .;0

5304;5310;101066;What it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .;2
4878;4884;93656;It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy , a kind of Elder Bueller 's Time Out .;3

5433;5439;103122;Campanella 's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over Rafael 's evolution .;3
6073;6081;114341;A quirky comedy set in Newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that 's so prevalent on The Rock .;3
6108;6116;114855;Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- I doubt it would be all that interesting .;0
5587;5593;105941;A sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .;1
5388;5394;102487;At its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating .;3
5726;5733;108320;Like Mike is n't going to make box office money that makes Michael Jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience -LRB- young Bow Wow fans -RRB- - with nothing but net .;3

5513;5519;104541;Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality;2
5806;5813;109690;This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .;0

6239;6248;117089;Few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as Nesbitt 's Cooper looks when the bullets stop flying .;3

5544;5550;105053;The enjoyable Undercover Brother , a zany mix of Saturday Night Live-style parody , '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .;4

5445;5451;103377;The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .;0

6132;6140;115263;Even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general 's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy .;3
6326;6335;118563;Bad movie .;0
5476;5482;103944;An enthralling aesthetic experience , one that 's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty .;4

6048;6056;113917;Allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today .;3
5810;5817;109792;It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .;0
6262;6271;117492;The Woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made Allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring .;3
5756;5763;108859;Often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it 's very much like life itself .;3

5343;5349;101626;With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .;1
5420;5426;102959;An unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years .;2

6343;6352;118856;The pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother , Donald , and directed by Spike Jonze .;3
6159;6167;115724;A confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design .;3

6284;6293;117848;Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment .;2
5527;5533;104764;Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .;2
5741;5748;108601;But even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic .;3
5951;5959;112221;A terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi .;4

6334;6343;118675;It 's harmless , diverting fluff .;2
5570;5576;105592;Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .;0

5532;5538;104859;There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .;0

6138;6146;115359;But it 's surprisingly harmless .;3
6312;6321;118316;If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good .;2
5382;5388;102386;Feardotcom 's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work .;2
5509;5515;104501;The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .;0
5719;5726;108220;My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...;0
6373;6383;119371;And for all the wrong reasons besides .;1
6306;6315;118221;This is n't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work .;2
5968;5976;112512;A not-so-Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood with a hefty helping of Re-Fried Green Tomatoes .;1
6348;6357;118939;Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .;2
5803;5810;109645;Miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .;4
5421;5427;102970;This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .;0
5948;5956;112163;Barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .;1
5748;5755;108719;An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .;0
6037;6045;113727;Ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled .;2
5887;5894;111187;`` The Tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for Chan that `` The Mask '' was for Jim Carrey .;2
5667;5673;107357;The film is delicately narrated by Martin Landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by Dana Janklowicz-Mann .;3
5790;5797;109455;Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .;1
6004;6012;113171;The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday .;4
5552;5558;105257;While not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging .;2
5367;5373;102070;The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .;1
5551;5557;105238;What elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish .;4
6381;6391;119554;A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .;4
6114;6122;114962;Kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story .;4
6075;6083;114386;You do n't want to call the cops .;2
6002;6010;113139;Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?;1
5652;5658;107093;As the Mediterranean sparkles , ` Swept Away ' sinks .;1
5402;5408;102666;And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .;2
5772;5779;109132;Ignoring that , he made Swimfan anyway;1
6147;6155;115516;... the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see .;4
5425;5431;103032;The year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but Take Care of My Cat emerges as the very best of them .;4
5841;5848;110394;You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .;0
6003;6011;113151;A first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you .;4
5655;5661;107138;An interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama .;4
6215;6223;116693;Despite its faults , Gangs excels in spectacle and pacing .;3
6207;6215;116548;Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression .;2
5675;5681;107516;It 's uninteresting .;0
5659;5665;107212;The Ring is worth a look , if you do n't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your Halloween entertainment .;2
5434;5440;103145;A refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale .;4
5996;6004;113061;Offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through .;3
5971;5979;112573;` The film is stark , straightforward and deadly ... an unnatural calm that 's occasionally shaken by ... blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . ';2
5802;5809;109635;The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .;0
5995;6003;113047;Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .;1
5830;5837;110207;Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .;0
5821;5828;110042;I 'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute .;2
6276;6285;117728;The Trials of Henry Kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ... because you get it .;4
5890;5897;111216;An entertaining British hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance .;4
6151;6159;115566;Spy Kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : It actually improves upon the original hit movie .;4
5456;5462;103572;Adaptation is simply brilliant .;4
6012;6020;113297;A real snooze .;0
5539;5545;104969;Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .;2
5778;5785;109238;Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .;0
5998;6006;113096;The picture does n't know it 's a comedy .;2
5579;5585;105795;Twenty years later , Reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .;2
5577;5583;105747;A horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .;1
5685;5691;107693;Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .;1
5398;5404;102620;One of the most incoherent features in recent memory .;0
5441;5447;103288;Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff .;4
5871;5878;110922;It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .;1
6049;6057;113933;The pleasure of Read My Lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string .;4
6283;6292;117814;Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .;0
6221;6229;116788;A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .;3
5725;5732;108297;There 's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like The Bourne Identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action .;3
5441;5447;103288;Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff .;4
6051;6059;113968;"The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .";0
5515;5521;104555;A captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age .;4
5892;5899;111249;The powerful success of Read My Lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director\/co-writer Jacques Audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of French filmmakers .;3
5349;5355;101711;Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .;1
5450;5456;103443;Poignant and moving , A Walk to Remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter .;4
5897;5904;111333;Saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion .;2
5895;5902;111292;Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .;3
6063;6071;114152;The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .;2
5658;5664;107177;Its story about a young Chinese woman , Ah Na , who has come to New York City to replace past tragedy with the American Dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling .;3
5374;5380;102233;The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .;1
5989;5997;112924;Barely .;2
6101;6109;114779;... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . '';1
6206;6214;116531;Trouble Every Day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead .;1
5875;5882;111012;A gem of a movie .;4
5560;5566;105386;What makes Salton Sea surprisingly engrossing is that Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .;4
5624;5630;106605;Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .;1
5816;5823;109920;Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .;1
6017;6025;113394;The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .;4
6133;6141;115306;And they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor .;3
5631;5637;106739;That Storytelling has value can not be denied .;4
5613;5619;106397;A pleasing , often-funny comedy .;3
5535;5541;104910;Mildly entertaining .;2
5402;5408;102666;And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .;2
6192;6200;116290;Not even Solondz 's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .;1
5523;5529;104687;A Lifetime movie about men .;2
5740;5747;108593;Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .;2
5650;5656;107075;Part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .;4
5945;5953;112134;Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .;0
5405;5411;102707;Sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group .;3
6248;6257;117259;Shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience .;3
6000;6008;113114;One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .;1
5451;5457;103461;While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .;1
5835;5842;110308;That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .;0
5463;5469;103688;J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .;3
5416;5422;102894;This documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -LRB- Evans -RRB- had , lost , and got back .;4
6172;6180;115934;... generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish .;2
5585;5591;105911;Ben Kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of Ghandi gone bad .;4
6117;6125;114997;What `` Empire '' lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart .;3
6297;6306;118038;Passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .;3
5571;5577;105622;Greengrass -LRB- working from Don Mullan 's script -RRB- forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in Northern Ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation .;2
5916;5924;111613;The film has an infectious enthusiasm and we 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport .;3
5784;5791;109343;Crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half .;3
5719;5726;108220;My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...;0
5623;5629;106579;The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .;0
5459;5465;103615;It will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .;3
6235;6244;117033;So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .;2
5362;5368;101976;... its stupidities wind up sticking in one 's mind a lot more than the cool bits .;2
6181;6189;116131;... there is enough originality in ` Life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens .;3
5544;5550;105053;The enjoyable Undercover Brother , a zany mix of Saturday Night Live-style parody , '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .;4
6195;6203;116329;A family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what is needed to live a rich and full life .;3
6214;6222;116686;Just watch Bettany strut his stuff .;2
5501;5507;104375;Delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for .;3
6340;6349;118776;Wang Xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men .;3
5460;5466;103647;Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .;1
5566;5572;105517;A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .;0
6110;6118;114880;Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .;1
5991;5999;112954;Devotees of Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best Next Generation episodes is lacking .;1
5422;5428;102977;"The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .";1
5657;5663;107163;The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .;2
6278;6287;117757;Like the best of Godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable .;4
5475;5481;103930;A must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle .;4
5547;5553;105121;What ` Dumb and Dumber ' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script .;2
5812;5819;109850;Grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length;1
6394;6404;119741;One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .;0
5896;5903;111317;Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .;0
5935;5943;111962;This is n't exactly profound cinema , but it 's good-natured and sometimes quite funny .;3
6322;6331;118484;If Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances .;1
6209;6217;116575;Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look .;3
6032;6040;113604;A crisp psychological drama -LRB- and -RRB- a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old `` Twilight Zone '' episode .;3
6226;6235;116860;The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .;2
5870;5877;110898;It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective .;2
6043;6051;113841;Chomp chomp !;2
6171;6179;115925;The results , if not memorable , are at least interesting .;2
5556;5562;105323;An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .;1
6124;6132;115113;Both a grand tour through 300 hundred years of Russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement .;4
5417;5423;102914;As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .;1
5474;5480;103903;Though Tom Shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .;1
5731;5738;108435;Woody Allen has really found his groove these days .;4
5521;5527;104663;` Tobey Maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . ';2
5453;5459;103501;` Anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . ';4
5627;5633;106655;You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?;2
5479;5485;104007;ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .;1
5856;5863;110599;When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .;1
5466;5472;103783;There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .;1
5507;5513;104462;` If you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . ';3
5590;5596;105975;You expect more from director Michael Apted -LRB- Enigma -RRB- and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup .;0
5434;5440;103145;A refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale .;4
5907;5914;111481;... quite endearing .;3
5873;5880;110980;The performances are immaculate , with Roussillon providing comic relief .;4
6270;6279;117665;It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .;1
5568;5574;105570;It 's a cool event for the whole family .;4
5776;5783;109215;This is just lazy writing .;0
5842;5849;110419;The actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way .;4
6107;6115;114849;Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?;2
5610;5616;106368;Hard to resist .;3
5430;5436;103094;A slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time .;4
5563;5569;105447;This dubious product of a college-spawned -LRB- Colgate U. -RRB- comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .;1
5844;5851;110448;It may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate .;2
6223;6232;116807;It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and The Laramie Project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in America .;4
5961;5969;112391;It 's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look .;3
6372;6382;119358;... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .;0
5851;5858;110534;The case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause .;4
5900;5907;111374;Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .;0
5387;5393;102460;The boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on Guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .;2
5807;5814;109727;Like The Rugrats movies , The Wild Thornberrys Movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .;3
5376;5382;102265;Much of this slick and sprightly CGI feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings .;3
5593;5599;106057;Watching Austin Powers in Goldmember is like binging on cotton candy .;3
6121;6129;115051;Frida is n't that much different from many a Hollywood romance .;1
5495;5501;104269;Good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .;4
6328;6337;118579;Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .;1
6350;6360;118982;Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them .;1
5742;5749;108612;Impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation ... just about as chilling and unsettling as ` Manhunter ' was .;4
6125;6133;115130;Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .;2
6247;6256;117252;This thing works on no level whatsoever for me .;0
5979;5987;112739;There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .;0
6250;6259;117303;Not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece .;4
6301;6310;118118;Undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos .;3
5558;5564;105356;Vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two English women .;2
5480;5486;104023;Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .;0
5515;5521;104555;A captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age .;4
5498;5504;104318;Michael Moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he 's got as potent a topic as ever here .;3

6371;6381;119349;The film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects .;4
5882;5889;111111;Henry Bean 's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect;3
5809;5816;109773;Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .;1
5505;5511;104438;Very stupid and annoying .;0
5676;5682;107519;Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .;1
5334;5340;101540;Really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length .;1
5669;5675;107402;Remove Spider-Man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it 's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies .;3
6330;6339;118603;It 's all entertaining enough , but do n't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper .;2
5679;5685;107571;Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .;0
5832;5839;110254;This is a nervy , risky film , and Villeneuve has inspired Croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of Bibi .;2
5888;5895;111204;This is one of the year 's best films .;4
6298;6307;118063;A chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody .;4
5720;5727;108234;Boyd 's screenplay -LRB- co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies -RRB- has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .;1
6314;6323;118375;Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?;1
5622;5628;106563;Like Kubrick , Soderbergh is n't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way .;3
5608;5614;106328;It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .;0
6167;6175;115858;The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .;0
5642;5648;106943;As commander-in-chief of this film , Bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world .;4
5660;5666;107230;Make like the title and dodge this one .;0
6384;6394;119586;If Ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .;3
5955;5963;112291;... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .;1
6178;6186;116047;Has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 're not interested .;3
5990;5998;112925;... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that I ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .;0
5944;5952;112115;Jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera 's drama and lyricism .;3
5687;5693;107717;This rich , bittersweet Israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man Pasach ` ke Burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .;3
5709;5716;108030;Just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective .;3
6220;6228;116771;It 's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes .;2
5863;5870;110804;-LRB- A -RRB- poorly executed comedy .;0
6051;6059;113968;"The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .";0
6150;6158;115550;Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie;0
5707;5714;107997;Watching The Powerpuff Girls Movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in Japan that gave people seizures .;3
5370;5376;102147;... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than -LRB- writer-director -RRB- Franc .;1
6059;6067;114139;It has plenty of laughs .;3
5650;5656;107075;Part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .;4
5386;5392;102445;Forget about one Oscar nomination for Julianne Moore this year - she should get all five .;4
6287;6296;117880;All mood and no movie .;1
5582;5588;105876;Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .;1
6166;6174;115851;A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .;0
5619;5625;106534;Arguably the best script that Besson has written in years .;4
5997;6005;113075;At its best -LRB- and it does have some very funny sequences -RRB- Looking for Leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be .;2
5759;5766;108915;It 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks .;2
6316;6325;118397;His scenes are short and often unexpected .;2
5896;5903;111317;Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .;0
5621;5627;106557;Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .;0
5495;5501;104269;Good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .;4
5411;5417;102790;Here is a divine monument to a single man 's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music .;4
6145;6153;115486;It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .;0
6379;6389;119501;Best of all is Garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .;4
5398;5404;102620;One of the most incoherent features in recent memory .;0
5368;5374;102092;Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh 's best films , `` Erin Brockovich , '' `` Out of Sight '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven , '' never were .;4
5879;5886;111057;... begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully .;3
5945;5953;112134;Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .;0
6269;6278;117656;An entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie .;3
6295;6304;118004;Admirers of director Abel Ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , R Xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form .;4
5925;5933;111788;It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .;0
6381;6391;119554;A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .;4
6084;6092;114511;Despite the predictable parent vs. child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at `` the real Americans '' make this a charmer .;4
5796;5803;109539;... unbearably lame .;0
5565;5571;105500;The climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does;2
5532;5538;104859;There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .;0
5640;5646;106921;The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .;1
5455;5461;103551;Sorority Boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .;0
6355;6365;119080;Each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs. man as Brother-Man vs. The Man .;2
5484;5490;104116;Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .;1
6380;6390;119516;Mr. Clooney , Mr. Kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster .;3
5835;5842;110308;That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .;0
5380;5386;102318;For most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director M. Night Shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that Mel Gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo .;4
5729;5736;108381;` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . ';0
6244;6253;117193;Egoyan 's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .;2
5362;5368;101976;... its stupidities wind up sticking in one 's mind a lot more than the cool bits .;2
6087;6095;114565;Boisterous , heartfelt comedy .;4
5813;5820;109867;The script by David Koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .;4
6154;6162;115618;Very well-written and very well-acted .;4
5788;5795;109419;This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .;1
5365;5371;102032;Whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama is n't much of a mystery , unfortunately .;2
5814;5821;109890;Washington overcomes the script 's flaws and envelops the audience in his character 's anguish , anger and frustration .;3
5449;5455;103434;By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .;1
5874;5881;110989;A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .;0
6334;6343;118675;It 's harmless , diverting fluff .;2
5413;5419;102822;Your children will be occupied for 72 minutes .;3
6095;6103;114684;But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .;1
5590;5596;105975;You expect more from director Michael Apted -LRB- Enigma -RRB- and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup .;0
5806;5813;109690;This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .;0
5688;5694;107742;Writer\/director David Caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza .;4
6036;6044;113701;It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .;1
5409;5415;102765;The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .;1
5502;5508;104391;Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .;1
6040;6048;113790;Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , Metropolis is a feast for the eyes .;4
5779;5786;109271;The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .;0
5909;5917;111508;It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .;2
5382;5388;102386;Feardotcom 's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work .;2
5633;5639;106764;Brilliantly written and well-acted , Yellow Asphalt is an uncompromising film .;4
5747;5754;108699;First and foremost ... the reason to go see `` Blue Crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by David Hennings .;4
5512;5518;104540;Crummy .;0
6352;6362;119018;... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .;2
5716;5723;108173;If you 're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , ENOUGH is just the ticket you need .;3
5733;5740;108466;A coming-of-age tale from New Zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board .;3
5958;5966;112337;Almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited .;2
6153;6161;115603;Maggie G. makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen .;4
5921;5929;111703;Beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm .;4
6118;6126;115008;Sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .;4
5407;5413;102737;`` Mr. Deeds '' is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought .;3
5737;5744;108525;A devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism .;0
5635;5641;106793;borrows a bit from the classics `` Wait Until Dark '' and `` Extremities '' ... But in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself .;4
5694;5701;107810;Confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from King Hunk .;3
6019;6027;113422;... salaciously simplistic .;2
5496;5502;104284;There are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .;2
6030;6038;113569;a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack;3
5400;5406;102636;This is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce .;3
6257;6266;117414;It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .;1
5605;5611;106270;... a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations .;3
5712;5719;108077;A thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it does n't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world .;3
5575;5581;105717;The movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it .;1
6374;6384;119378;Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .;3
5456;5462;103572;Adaptation is simply brilliant .;4
5984;5992;112843;You have no affinity for most of the characters .;0
5877;5884;111034;Simply put , `` Far From Heaven '' is a masterpiece .;4
5774;5781;109162;Though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , Ozpetek falls short in showing us Antonia 's true emotions ... But at the very least , His Secret Life will leave you thinking .;3
5626;5632;106645;Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit;2
6345;6354;118909;Sexy and romantic .;4
6085;6093;114535;Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .;0
6246;6255;117225;Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .;0
5530;5536;104829;A remarkable film by Bernard Rose .;4
6273;6282;117688;Bang !;2
5614;5620;106403;There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .;1
5964;5972;112429;There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .;1
5981;5989;112787;It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .;0
6280;6289;117776;Puts to rest any thought that the German film industry can not make a delightful comedy centering on food .;4
5695;5702;107821;Do n't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .;2
6020;6028;113426;A fanciful drama about Napoleon 's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility .;4
5823;5830;110090;`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .;0
6319;6328;118434;That rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .;3
5717;5724;108197;Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .;1
5423;5429;102999;This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .;2
5982;5990;112806;Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .;1
5869;5876;110883;Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me -LRB- horrors ! -RRB-;3
5914;5922;111601;It 's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen .;1
6025;6033;113485;About Schmidt belongs to Nicholson .;3
6227;6236;116871;Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .;0
5347;5353;101679;Director Roger Kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity .;3
6077;6085;114415;A genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama .;4
6368;6378;119321;brought to life on the big screen .;3
5464;5470;103720;Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .;0
6111;6119;114899;The story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy .;3
5381;5387;102355;It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .;1
5998;6006;113096;The picture does n't know it 's a comedy .;2
6321;6330;118476;are both superb , while Huppert ... is magnificent .;4
6168;6176;115867;The solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre .;4
5922;5930;111710;The camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm .;4
5992;6000;112985;Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , Vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .;1
5637;5643;106844;An older cad instructs a younger lad in Zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy .;3
6305;6314;118212;Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .;0
6194;6202;116324;Another entertaining romp from Robert Rodriguez .;3
5799;5806;109578;It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .;1
5757;5764;108877;But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .;1
5760;5767;108936;With this masterful , flawless film , -LRB- Wang -RRB- emerges in the front ranks of China 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers .;4
5826;5833;110145;Ramsay and Morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling .;3
5457;5463;103575;I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .;3
5810;5817;109792;It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .;0
5987;5995;112881;Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .;2
6205;6213;116517;A B-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget .;3
6105;6113;114831;classic cinema served up with heart and humor;4
5551;5557;105238;What elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish .;4

5932;5940;111901;Tsai Ming-liang 's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being .;2
6231;6240;116971;Then you 'd do well to check this one out because it 's straight up Twin Peaks action ...;3
5752;5759;108773;The one not-so-small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .;1
5662;5668;107261;Adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of Orlean 's themes without being a true adaptation of her book .;3
5969;5977;112531;A fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . ';4
6349;6359;118957;It finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice .;3
5900;5907;111374;Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .;0
6022;6030;113455;The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .;1
6119;6127;115025;As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .;0
5780;5787;109284;A riveting documentary .;4
5819;5826;109994;It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .;2
5390;5396;102503;Graphic sex may be what 's attracting audiences to Unfaithful , but gripping performances by Lane and Gere are what will keep them awake .;4
5908;5915;111484;It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .;1
6019;6027;113422;... salaciously simplistic .;2
6135;6143;115329;Too predictably , in fact .;1
5497;5503;104309;For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .;2
5786;5793;109384;Jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging .;3
5573;5579;105685;And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .;3
5750;5757;108761;It 's not too fast and not too slow .;3
5442;5448;103323;Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .;2
6141;6149;115388;As the movie traces Mr. Brown 's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .;4
5917;5925;111638;You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .;0
6299;6308;118094;... one of the more influential works of the ` Korean New Wave ' .;4
5338;5344;101574;This New Zealand coming-of-age movie is n't really about anything .;1
5801;5808;109623;A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .;3
6018;6026;113406;El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .;1
5602;5608;106183;In addition to Hoffman 's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday .;4
