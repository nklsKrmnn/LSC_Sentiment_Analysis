4818;4824;92584;Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .;1
4488;4493;86718;Nohe 's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : He is n't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction .;3
4725;4730;90911;It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy .;1

4937;4943;94729;Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild .;2
4514;4519;87119;A compelling pre-WWII drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message .;4

5153;5159;98420;While it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight .;3
4693;4698;90261;The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .;4
4439;4444;85861;Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .;1

4646;4651;89459;A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .;1
4470;4475;86442;The sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film .;3

4683;4688;90068;Despite its raucous intent , XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad and as rebellious as spring break .;2
5230;5236;99796;A marvel of production design .;4

4748;4753;91372;Sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this Argentinean ` dramedy ' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors .;3
4865;4871;93414;An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality .;1
5034;5040;96458;Not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made .;3
4821;4827;92645;A huge box-office hit in Korea , Shiri is a must for genre fans .;3
4874;4880;93575;The film reminds me of a vastly improved Germanic version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style .;3
4467;4472;86371;It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .;1
4954;4960;95096;No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .;0
5184;5190;98947;An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .;1
5022;5028;96248;This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .;1
4536;4541;87520;Thoroughly awful .;0
4479;4484;86592;The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? ';2
4370;4375;84561;There 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .;3
4940;4946;94803;Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .;0

4814;4820;92541;The story itself is actually quite vapid .;1
5050;5056;96791;The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .;0

4894;4900;93917;You can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer .;2
4486;4491;86688;No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .;0
4329;4333;83840;Yes they can swim , the title is merely Anne-Sophie Birot 's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through .;2
4445;4450;86002;Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .;3

5239;5245;99950;It 's not particularly subtle ... However , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .;2
5195;5201;99172;The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .;0
4840;4846;93029;A drama ?;2
5125;5131;97956;Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .;1
4906;4912;94131;It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .;2
4716;4721;90682;An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .;1

4316;4320;83579;The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .;0
5035;5041;96476;True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .;1
4829;4835;92812;I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was Earnest .;4
5310;5316;101154;Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .;1
4377;4382;84690;With Rare Birds , as with The Shipping News before it , an attempt is made to transplant a Hollywood star into Newfoundland 's wild soil -- and The Rock once again resists the intrusion .;2
4333;4337;83917;Makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student 's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted .;3
4884;4890;93762;The movie is ingenious fun .;4
4981;4987;95498;The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .;0
4282;4286;83031;Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .;1
5165;5171;98638;It 's always enthralling .;4
5150;5156;98369;Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime .;1

4421;4426;85583;The obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .;2
4923;4929;94421;As ex-Marine Walter , who may or may not have shot Kennedy , actor Raymond J. Barry is perfectly creepy and believable .;3
4870;4876;93515;After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .;0
4815;4821;92546;This new Time Machine is hardly perfect ... yet it proves surprisingly serviceable .;2
4660;4665;89654;As violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you 've ever seen .;1
4927;4933;94505;Beautifully reclaiming the story of Carmen and recreating it an in an African idiom .;3

5048;5054;96761;What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .;0
4985;4991;95579;A poignant comedy that offers food for thought .;4
4911;4917;94204;The film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end .;2
5252;5258;100207;For those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed .;3
4931;4937;94568;No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .;0

4451;4456;86069;both overstuffed and undernourished ... The film ca n't be called a solid success , although there 's plenty of evidence here to indicate Clooney might have better luck next time .;2
4996;5002;95763;As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .;1
4410;4415;85376;It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .;1
5033;5039;96441;The film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .;3
4585;4590;88364;A serious movie with serious ideas .;4
4893;4899;93894;For devotees of French cinema , Safe Conduct is so rich with period minutiae it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven .;4
4886;4892;93793;It 's a fanboy ` what if ? ';2
4466;4471;86351;The work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them .;3
4695;4700;90281;Connoisseurs of Chinese film will be pleased to discover that Tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus .;3
4353;4357;84321;By the end you ca n't help but feel ` stoked . ';3
5220;5226;99609;There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .;2
4536;4541;87520;Thoroughly awful .;0
5214;5220;99546;Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .;0
4519;4524;87209;Sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .;2
5181;5187;98880;Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .;1
5025;5031;96323;Gives everyone something to shout about .;4
4532;4537;87448;The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .;1
4791;4797;92180;A surprisingly funny movie .;4
4572;4577;88117;The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .;0
5231;5237;99800;Nicole Holofcener 's Lovely and Amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style .;4
4627;4632;89089;While Parker and co-writer Catherine di Napoli are faithful to Melville 's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast ... have made the old boy 's characters more quick-witted than any English Lit major would have thought possible .;4
4891;4897;93864;When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?;1
4934;4940;94633;The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .;2
5106;5112;97658;This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .;0
5234;5240;99867;I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .;0
4844;4850;93075;I 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but;2
4768;4774;91736;I 'll put it this way : If you 're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you .;2
4390;4395;85005;has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs .;3
5082;5088;97308;It 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama .;4
4792;4798;92184;With not a lot of help from the screenplay -LRB- proficient , but singularly cursory -RRB- , -LRB- Testud -RRB- acts with the feral intensity of the young Bette Davis .;2
4269;4273;82728;The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .;2
4546;4551;87642;There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure .;4
4552;4557;87768;Does n't add up to much .;0
5190;5196;99062;`` It 's all about the image . '';2
4972;4978;95361;A very pretty after-school special .;2
4669;4674;89812;Scooby Doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation .;4
4982;4988;95536;-LRB- T -RRB- oo many of these gross out scenes ...;1
5211;5217;99480;Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .;1
4451;4456;86069;both overstuffed and undernourished ... The film ca n't be called a solid success , although there 's plenty of evidence here to indicate Clooney might have better luck next time .;2
5210;5216;99479;that works .;3
5052;5058;96807;One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .;0
5021;5027;96226;No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .;4
5154;5160;98447;There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .;0
5280;5286;100671;De Niro cries .;2
5119;5125;97868;Many a parent and their teen -LRB- or preteen -RRB- kid could bond while watching A Walk To Remember .;4
4729;4734;90987;There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid;1
4539;4544;87563;Intimate and panoramic .;3
4291;4295;83192;I ca n't .;2
4715;4720;90663;Confessions is n't always coherent , but it 's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong .;3
4507;4512;87029;A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .;1
4783;4789;92036;An impressive hybrid .;4
5007;5013;95936;It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .;4
4402;4407;85225;Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring Ice-T in a major role .;3
4918;4924;94353;Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .;0
4505;4510;87001;One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .;0
5017;5023;96143;It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least .;3
4512;4517;87075;Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .;0
4967;4973;95271;Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .;1
4492;4497;86801;A gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable .;4
5196;5202;99197;One of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it 's far tamer than advertised .;3
4484;4489;86644;Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .;1
4447;4452;86039;Brisk hack job .;0
4879;4885;93677;A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .;0
4311;4315;83495;Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .;2
5245;5251;100071;The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .;0
5281;5287;100674;A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .;1
4790;4796;92159;Bad in such a bizarre way that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .;2
4438;4443;85842;Your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make .;2
4988;4994;95631;While the story 's undeniably hard to follow , Iwai 's gorgeous visuals seduce .;3
5315;5321;101223;Sadly , Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .;1
5127;5133;97998;All three women deliver remarkable performances .;3
4816;4822;92558;Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .;0
4991;4997;95654;Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .;3
4549;4554;87695;Walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in Janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .;2
4415;4420;85455;Every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat .;4
4789;4795;92137;A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .;1
5020;5026;96203;It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .;1
4688;4693;90170;You 'll get the enjoyable basic minimum .;2
4597;4602;88569;Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso .;1
4580;4585;88274;Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .;1
4321;4325;83672;The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .;3
4431;4436;85751;The action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the Star Wars series .;3
5136;5142;98151;It is quite a vision .;3
4645;4650;89441;You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .;0
4289;4293;83156;Robin Williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of Bicentennial Man in favour of an altogether darker side .;3
5164;5170;98628;Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .;2
4504;4509;86972;As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .;3
4471;4476;86451;An extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary China .;3
4682;4687;90063;It 's Splash without the jokes .;0
5110;5116;97713;Maybe LeBlanc thought , `` Hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . '';1
4544;4549;87605;A plodding look at the French Revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .;2
4709;4714;90548;A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .;0
5114;5120;97787;An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .;1
4843;4849;93064;It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .;0
4796;4802;92261;than ` Magnifique ' .;2
4555;4560;87789;A lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family .;4
4587;4592;88377;Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .;1
4679;4684;90029;The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . '';1
5229;5235;99773;Tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .;3
4922;4928;94408;Becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .;0
5261;5267;100362;The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .;4
4323;4327;83709;Goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse .;2
5284;5290;100712;It 's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by Elizabeth Hurley in a bathing suit .;2
5072;5078;97132;Hate it because it 's lousy .;0
4310;4314;83486;Significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition .;3
5266;5272;100481;Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .;1
4387;4392;84957;A film in a class with Spike Lee 's masterful Do The Right Thing .;4
4526;4531;87352;Lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience .;0
5135;5141;98123;... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .;0
4770;4776;91763;Taken as a whole , The Tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .;1
4591;4596;88435;I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .;1
4889;4895;93824;` Like a child with an important message to tell ... -LRB- Skins ' -RRB- faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . ';2
4662;4667;89672;Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .;1
4680;4685;90044;Ah , the travails of metropolitan life !;2
4801;4807;92342;One of the best rock documentaries ever .;4
4877;4883;93646;Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .;0
4776;4782;91890;Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .;0
4766;4772;91702;What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .;1

4548;4553;87677;Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ?;2
4707;4712;90517;Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard .;3
5217;5223;99579;Dense and enigmatic ... elusive ... stagy and stilted;2
5019;5025;96176;Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .;1
4417;4422;85509;Angel presents events partly from the perspective of Aurelie and Christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale .;3
4622;4627;89027;Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .;1
4966;4972;95268;Wise and deadpan humorous .;3
4928;4934;94519;but rather , ` How can you charge money for this ? ';0
4733;4738;91079;Watching this film , what we feel is n't mainly suspense or excitement .;1
4443;4448;85965;One-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation .;1
5061;5067;96929;If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .;2
4327;4331;83777;All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .;0
4881;4887;93713;Simple , poignant and leavened with humor , it 's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship .;3
4405;4410;85280;Much of All About Lily Chou-Chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep .;4
4696;4701;90306;-LRB- Taymor -RRB- utilizes the idea of making Kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work .;4
4681;4686;90050;No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .;0
5001;5007;95818;Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .;3
4411;4416;85386;Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .;0
4669;4674;89812;Scooby Doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation .;4
4270;4274;82743;A road trip that will get you thinking , ` Are we there yet ? ';2
5283;5289;100690;May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .;0
5167;5173;98656;Morvern Callar confirms Lynne Ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema .;4
4411;4416;85386;Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .;0
4905;4911;94125;Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .;2
5004;5010;95885;Much of The Lady and the Duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes .;3
4312;4316;83508;The big-screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison .;0
4738;4743;91174;Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout Maelstrom .;2
4852;4858;93194;It 's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .;2
4841;4847;93031;A fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .;2
4775;4781;91857;High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .;0
4313;4317;83521;A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .;0
5199;5205;99246;Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .;4
4571;4576;88108;The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .;1
4401;4406;85188;The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .;1
4424;4429;85649;Whatever one makes of its political edge , this is beautiful filmmaking from one of French cinema 's master craftsmen .;4
4735;4740;91105;A damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film .;4
4589;4594;88411;A fairly enjoyable mixture of Longest Yard ... and the 1999 Guy Ritchie caper Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels .;3
5300;5306;101005;It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .;1
4780;4786;91967;We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .;0
4575;4580;88176;A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .;2
4573;4578;88132;The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years .;3
4678;4683;89998;Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .;2
5149;5155;98349;While obviously aimed at kids , The Country Bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio .;3
4606;4611;88751;Rifkin 's references are ... impeccable throughout .;4
4734;4739;91089;It gives devastating testimony to both people 's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good .;3
4499;4504;86897;The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .;1
4309;4313;83477;Smart , sassy interpretation of the Oscar Wilde play .;4
4338;4342;84037;Lathan and Diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .;3
5305;5311;101085;... spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative .;4
4392;4397;85017;Films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days .;3
4666;4671;89760;Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .;1
5266;5272;100481;Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .;1
5197;5203;99219;The issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's -LRB- unintentionally -RRB- funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care .;0
4882;4888;93732;Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .;2
4693;4698;90261;The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .;4
4393;4398;85028;I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .;0
4426;4431;85682;Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .;0
5134;5140;98112;A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .;1
4899;4905;94002;It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .;2
5007;5013;95936;It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .;4
5259;5265;100345;Mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully .;4
4798;4804;92295;It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .;0
5268;5274;100518;A film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .;4
5222;5228;99658;Would n't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II ?;2
4375;4380;84643;A hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as Grant 's two best films -- Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones 's Diary .;4
4297;4301;83280;What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .;0
5319;5325;101313;Unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .;1
4910;4916;94183;There is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling .;3
4802;4808;92349;A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .;0
4364;4369;84467;An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .;0
5313;5319;101197;Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .;1
5291;5297;100849;... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .;2
4859;4865;93287;That death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world 's religions .;2
4779;4785;91958;Boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing .;3
4684;4689;90088;This is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller .;4
5177;5183;98811;The footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with Suge Knight are just two of the elements that will grab you .;3

4917;4923;94312;As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .;1

4806;4812;92409;A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff .;1
5265;5271;100468;It strikes hardest ... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain .;3
4496;4501;86865;This is an interesting movie ! '';4

4838;4844;92979;Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .;1

5304;5310;101066;What it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .;2
4878;4884;93656;It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy , a kind of Elder Bueller 's Time Out .;3

4320;4324;83641;The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .;0

5021;5027;96226;No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .;4
