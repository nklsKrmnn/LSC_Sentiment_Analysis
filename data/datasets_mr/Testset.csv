7688;7702;141995;Well-made but mush-hearted .;3
7981;7995;146909;The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .;0
8131;8145;149626;The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .;2
7547;7561;139421;It 's no accident that The Accidental Spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form .;4
7529;7543;139158;It 's a scorcher .;3
8304;8318;152426;Rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema .;4
7834;7848;144571;Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .;0
8512;8527;155781;Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .;1
8352;8366;153177;It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .;0
7590;7604;140129;Like other great documentaries ... this goes after one truth -LRB- the Ford administration 's complicity in tearing ` orphans ' from their mothers -RRB- and stumbles upon others even more compelling .;2
8455;8470;154834;Huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling Kathy Baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on Boston Public just as much as 8 Women 's Augustine .;3
8159;8173;150039;Singer\/composer Bryan Adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .;3
8371;8385;153532;So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .;1
7472;7486;138297;Sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50 .;0
8011;8025;147466;The actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face .;1
7637;7651;141065;The trailer is a riot .;4
7848;7862;144823;Mr. Scorsese 's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated .;3
8144;8158;149819;The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .;0
8369;8383;153475;After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .;1
8250;8264;151517;The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .;1
8132;8146;149643;That the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that Chin 's film serves up with style and empathy .;3
7504;7518;138732;Filled with Alexandre Desplat 's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience .;4
8442;8457;154671;Ill-considered , unholy hokum .;1
8383;8397;153731;Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... Ghost Blimp ?;1
8413;8427;154227;More mature than Fatal Attraction , more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 Weeks , Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .;4
7916;7930;145849;But mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived .;4
8147;8161;149879;It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .;0
8406;8420;154118;Alarms for Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .;3
8009;8023;147441;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .;2
8027;8041;147785;Given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .;0
7686;7700;141961;It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .;3
8277;8291;151935;Vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order .;2
7526;7540;139088;Made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age ... and then only as a very mild rental .;2
8150;8164;149912;An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .;2
8197;8211;150642;This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .;0
7507;7521;138761;This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .;1
8187;8201;150495;Thumbs up to Paxton for not falling into the Hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer .;4
7491;7505;138563;This film biggest problem ?;1
7603;7617;140354;It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .;4
7805;7819;144070;Low rent from frame one .;1
7569;7583;139735;While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .;1
8047;8061;148107;Some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since `` Saving Private Ryan '' have been recreated by John Woo in this little-known story of Native Americans and their role in the second great war .;3
8155;8169;150004;The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .;1
8314;8328;152601;The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .;4
8026;8040;147771;Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .;0
8230;8244;151225;Who cares ? -RRB- .;1
8118;8132;149408;Like The Full Monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .;4
7853;7867;144875;A fine production with splendid singing by Angela Gheorghiu , Ruggero Raimondi , and Roberto Alagna .;4
7998;8012;147247;Wanker Goths are on the loose !;2
8057;8071;148322;A well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature .;4
8313;8327;152581;A glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism .;3
8091;8105;148969;The script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .;1
8424;8438;154377;A wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture .;3
7669;7683;141592;Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .;1
8004;8018;147355;A fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the New Age .;4
7481;7495;138424;Just dreadful .;0
7910;7924;145783;Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .;0
8169;8183;150226;If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .;1
8515;8531;155837;Even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , East-vs .;2
8309;8323;152534;Merci pour le movie .;2
8452;8467;154775;At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .;0
7543;7557;139378;That , in itself , is extraordinary .;4
8165;8179;150155;A remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .;3
7728;7742;142626;The film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill .;3
8083;8097;148827;A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .;1
7868;7882;145084;It 's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties .;3
7978;7992;146880;Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia ?;2
7604;7618;140374;The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .;2
8240;8254;151383;Congrats Disney on a job well done , I enjoyed it just as much !;4
7939;7953;146269;Just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .;3
7846;7860;144793;Runs on the pure adrenalin of Pacino 's performance .;4
8432;8447;154526;Shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , Devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives .;4
7946;7960;146358;Call this The Full Monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux .;2
7942;7956;146297;Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .;1
7790;7804;143796;Tres Greek writer and star Nia Vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script .;3
8429;8444;154458;Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .;0
7871;7885;145129;Well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin .;4
8060;8074;148373;Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .;0
7514;7528;138893;An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .;1
7869;7883;145106;an admirable , sometimes exceptional film;4
7931;7945;146111;One of the finest , most humane and important Holocaust movies ever made .;4
7754;7768;143105;Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .;0
7671;7685;141662;Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting .;4
8270;8284;151811;Plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made Miike ... a cult hero .;2
7836;7850;144602;Even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st Century .;3
8004;8018;147355;A fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the New Age .;4
7757;7771;143146;This ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy -LRB- if not entirely wholesome -RRB- fun .;3
7509;7523;138798;` Would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? ';2
8382;8396;153719;Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .;1
8272;8286;151845;An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .;1
8289;8303;152189;... a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor .;2
7953;7967;146459;While the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you wo n't care .;3
8239;8253;151365;A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached .;4
8344;8358;153063;... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .;1
7715;7729;142459;A moving , if uneven , success .;3
8120;8134;149431;Upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .;3
7684;7698;141900;Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .;0
8351;8365;153175;Sex With Strangers is fascinating ...;4
8141;8155;149780;Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .;2
7482;7496;138426;This is pure , exciting moviemaking .;4
7474;7488;138325;under-rehearsed and lifeless;0
8210;8224;150851;An eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake .;4
7570;7584;139759;Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .;4
7863;7877;145020;`` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...;3
8265;8279;151727;Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .;4
7994;8008;147170;There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .;1
8435;8450;154555;This method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .;4
8305;8319;152451;There 's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane .;2
8006;8020;147390;The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .;0
8315;8329;152622;It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .;1
8419;8433;154308;A markedly inactive film , City is conversational bordering on confessional .;0
7787;7801;143741;Does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background .;3
7816;7830;144261;Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .;2
7556;7570;139532;Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .;1
8422;8436;154347;Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .;1
8484;8499;155269;It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .;3
8235;8249;151318;Good , solid storytelling .;4
7549;7563;139455;This story still seems timely and important .;3
7633;7647;140984;What does n't this film have that an impressionable kid could n't stand to hear ?;3
7579;7593;139960;But then again , I hate myself most mornings .;1
8354;8368;153229;Just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole .;1
8014;8028;147520;While the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .;1
7545;7559;139403;The movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .;2
8163;8177;150113;Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .;0
7941;7955;146290;Lurid and less than lucid work .;1
8015;8029;147547;It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .;3
8468;8483;155024;A ragbag of cliches .;0
8397;8411;153934;After watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history .;3
8342;8356;153024;Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .;0
8111;8125;149305;An elegant and sly deadpan comedy .;3
7773;7787;143450;Like its New England characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness .;3
7544;7558;139382;The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .;1
7982;7996;146923;The biggest problem with this movie is that it 's not nearly long enough .;2
8237;8251;151351;We 're drawn in by the dark luster .;3
8191;8205;150560;The chocolate factory without Charlie .;1
8284;8298;152086;It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .;1
7703;7717;142239;Constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act .;3
8152;8166;149930;If you grew up on Scooby -- you 'll love this movie .;3
7625;7639;140823;The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .;1
7570;7584;139759;Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .;4
7568;7582;139731;Too bad none of it is funny .;0
8046;8060;148088;Me Without You has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood .;4
8107;8121;149231;It really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` Evelyn . ';3
8425;8439;154394;Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .;2
8355;8369;153245;And it 's a lousy one at that .;0
8234;8248;151286;A typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate French coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it .;2
8075;8089;148675;Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss .;3
7789;7803;143780;Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .;1
8418;8432;154285;A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .;0
8321;8335;152746;A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .;1
7786;7800;143711;It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .;1
8175;8189;150345;Humorous and heartfelt , Douglas McGrath 's version of ` Nicholas Nickleby ' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful .;4
7963;7977;146635;It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .;1
8127;8141;149565;With an admirably dark first script by Brent Hanley , Paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work .;4
7718;7732;142472;Every note rings false .;1
8323;8337;152768;A beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps Dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions .;3
7962;7976;146623;Kinnear and Dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers .;4
7810;7824;144134;Comedy troupe Broken Lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot .;2
8318;8332;152693;Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?;1
8274;8288;151896;Renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance .;4
8013;8027;147484;In questioning the election process , Payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the Iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box .;3
7687;7701;141985;Although I did n't hate this one , it 's not very good either .;1
8142;8156;149800;An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .;0
8293;8307;152245;It 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look .;2
7524;7538;139059;One of the year 's best films , featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Julianne Moore .;4
7955;7969;146491;The movie is a desperate miscalculation .;0
7774;7788;143483;A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .;1
8304;8318;152426;Rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema .;4
8236;8250;151322;As gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting .;4
8022;8036;147670;too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .;0
7709;7723;142354;... a true delight .;4
7945;7959;146346;If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .;0
8162;8176;150090;You 'll forget about it by Monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids .;0

7751;7765;143050;Schneidermeister ... Makin ' a fool of himself ... Losin ' his fan base ...;1
7819;7833;144274;A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .;1
8272;8286;151845;An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .;1
7959;7973;146581;A tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship .;2
7719;7733;142476;An extraordinarily silly thriller .;2
8190;8204;150549;It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity .;3
8210;8224;150851;An eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake .;4
7986;8000;146990;A film with a great premise but only a great premise .;3
8498;8513;155528;A gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost .;4
7910;7924;145783;Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .;0
8504;8519;155646;With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .;1
8248;8262;151498;Oozes condescension from every pore .;2
8140;8154;149773;Sorvino is delightful in the central role .;3
8247;8261;151479;A rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and Japanese animation .;3
8177;8191;150364;May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .;1
7818;7832;144270;Darkly funny and frequently insightful .;4

8029;8043;147823;This is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain .;4
8454;8469;154825;Samuel L. Jackson is one of the best actors there is .;4
7603;7617;140354;It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .;4
7853;7867;144875;A fine production with splendid singing by Angela Gheorghiu , Ruggero Raimondi , and Roberto Alagna .;4
7564;7578;139684;From the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait .;3
8029;8043;147823;This is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain .;4
8500;8515;155571;It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .;4
7938;7952;146243;A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . ';0
7527;7541;139115;The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .;1
7531;7545;139183;Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .;2
7532;7546;139214;It is OK for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged .;3
8058;8072;148332;An old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts .;3
7623;7637;140765;It 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .;4
7575;7589;139861;More timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by Iran to the Afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food .;4
7499;7513;138658;The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .;0
7891;7905;145459;Bring tissues .;3
8008;8022;147431;There is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all .;3
8001;8015;147293;It 's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism .;4
8335;8349;152948;Michel Piccoli 's moving performance is this films reason for being .;3
8113;8127;149341;The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .;0
8057;8071;148322;A well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature .;4
8303;8317;152404;... best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the Warren Report .;2
8105;8119;149207;As happily glib and vicious as its characters .;2
7674;7688;141729;It 's quite diverting nonsense .;1
7817;7831;144268;A gripping drama .;4
7873;7887;145161;The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .;2
7620;7634;140706;It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .;0
7494;7508;138601;Amazingly lame .;0
8103;8117;149175;This is amusing for about three minutes .;2
8434;8449;154552;Staggeringly dreadful romance .;0
7922;7936;145936;Medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt .;1
8113;8127;149341;The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .;0
8332;8346;152891;Succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides .;3
8353;8367;153201;Anyone who 's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved .;2
7475;7489;138328;The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...;1
7866;7880;145063;Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance;0
8037;8051;147938;Nair does n't treat the issues lightly .;3
8095;8109;149038;This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .;1
8200;8214;150685;Easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-Semitism ever seen on screen .;4
8305;8319;152451;There 's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane .;2
7742;7756;142902;It depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept .;2
7540;7554;139322;A touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by Michel Piccoli .;4
7857;7871;144934;An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .;0
8136;8150;149707;A thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions .;4
8086;8100;148884;A captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller .;3
8065;8079;148472;The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .;1
8372;8386;153561;By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .;0
7474;7488;138325;under-rehearsed and lifeless;0
8434;8449;154552;Staggeringly dreadful romance .;0
7924;7938;145968;An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .;1
8322;8336;152758;When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .;0
8427;8441;154424;Nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , Warm Water may well be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy .;4
8112;8126;149309;With its hint of an awkward Hitchcockian theme in tact , Harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone;2
7874;7888;145180;The comedy is nonexistent .;0
8213;8227;150930;Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .;1
7852;7866;144866;In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .;0
8174;8188;150331;As a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , Kissing Jessica Steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious .;4
7918;7932;145903;Succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture .;3
8214;8228;150940;- I also wanted a little alien as a friend !;3
8164;8178;150134;"No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .";0
7677;7691;141766;The more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it .;3
7484;7498;138444;The director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn .;2
7857;7871;144934;An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .;0
7763;7777;143258;More concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , Soderbergh 's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .;4
7736;7750;142796;The obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc .;3
7988;8002;147005;Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .;1
7634;7648;140997;A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .;1
8115;8129;149382;Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .;0
7995;8009;147206;made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .;3
7648;7662;141257;It may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .;4

8221;8235;151080;Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .;0
8220;8234;151053;A frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .;0
8379;8393;153692;A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .;2
8303;8317;152404;... best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the Warren Report .;2
8418;8432;154285;A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .;0
8123;8137;149494;Could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals .;3
8188;8202;150513;Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .;1
7501;7515;138672;The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .;0
7550;7564;139461;A complete waste of time .;1
7705;7719;142278;Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .;1
7968;7982;146730;But Mr. Polanski creates images even more haunting than those in Mr. Spielberg 's 1993 classic .;4
8072;8086;148626;Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .;1
7595;7609;140211;O Fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing .;3
8246;8260;151461;Cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy .;2
7949;7963;146406;A manically generous Christmas vaudeville .;3
7623;7637;140765;It 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .;4
7601;7615;140311;For all the wit and hoopla , Festival In Cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships .;3
7944;7958;146335;Hollywood Ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless .;3
8145;8159;149851;Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .;1
8017;8031;147598;Norton holds the film together .;2

8071;8085;148595;What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .;1
8202;8216;150726;I have to admit I walked out of Runteldat .;0
7513;7527;138874;The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .;0
8426;8440;154405;Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .;1
7980;7994;146906;Quelle surprise !;2
7778;7792;143554;One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before .;1
8219;8233;151035;It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .;0
8454;8469;154825;Samuel L. Jackson is one of the best actors there is .;4
7651;7665;141316;He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .;1
7645;7659;141194;Stands as one of the year 's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be .;4
7860;7874;144978;The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .;1
7804;7818;144041;The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- .;1
8338;8352;152981;The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .;2
7754;7768;143105;Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .;0
7766;7780;143322;Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .;2
8081;8095;148792;It is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it .;4
8050;8064;148184;There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .;1
8375;8389;153623;Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .;1
7699;7713;142163;A very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be .;3
8019;8033;147614;The film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished .;4
7880;7894;145275;Too bad Kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up .;1
8012;8026;147479;Stress ` dumb . ';1
7913;7927;145828;Really quite funny .;4
7617;7631;140651;All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .;1
8212;8226;150898;Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham .;4
7900;7914;145580;It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .;0
8428;8442;154439;Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .;1
8085;8099;148857;One of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .;1
7535;7549;139252;Features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .;0
7779;7793;143570;Oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition .;2
7650;7664;141295;The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .;1

7559;7573;139570;Leave it to John Sayles to take on developers , the Chamber of Commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie ... without neglecting character development for even one minute .;4
8346;8360;153080;Denis forges out of the theories of class - based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord .;2
7467;7481;138229;Steven Spielberg brings us another masterpiece;4
7566;7580;139700;An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .;1
8474;8489;155099;For all its brilliant touches , Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .;1
8317;8331;152661;Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?;1
7471;7485;138281;City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .;3
7930;7944;146089;If we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like Tim McCann 's Revolution No. 9 .;3
8201;8215;150700;Conceptually brilliant ... Plays like a living-room War Of The Worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown .;3
8056;8070;148284;What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .;0
8423;8437;154359;The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from Spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable .;3
8365;8379;153406;this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it 's a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .;2
7496;7510;138617;Moretti plays Giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy .;2
7508;7522;138772;Mostly Martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it 's a pleasurable trifle .;2
7614;7628;140571;Authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow .;2
8105;8119;149207;As happily glib and vicious as its characters .;2
7983;7997;146932;The movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it .;2
8273;8287;151869;In its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , Time Out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything I have seen in an American film .;3
7598;7612;140263;The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !;0
8489;8504;155377;Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .;1
7956;7970;146496;the film does n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half;1
8150;8164;149912;An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .;2
7493;7507;138587;Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss .;3
8275;8289;151906;... if you 're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch Freaks as a matinee .;2
7775;7789;143513;It is a likable story , told with competence .;3
7538;7552;139286;The best comedy concert movie I 've seen since Cho 's previous concert comedy film , I 'm the One That I Want , in 2000 .;4
8088;8102;148918;I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .;3
8239;8253;151365;A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached .;4
8277;8291;151935;Vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order .;2
7708;7722;142329;Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .;0
8432;8447;154526;Shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , Devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives .;4
7551;7565;139462;Just plain bad .;0
8510;8525;155734;None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .;1
8216;8230;150974;Forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?;1
8291;8305;152219;He 's not good with people .;1
8405;8419;154102;Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .;1
8411;8425;154173;If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .;3
8525;8541;155998;Despite these annoyances , the capable Clayburgh and Tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age .;2
7589;7603;140112;Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film .;2
7565;7579;139699;Refreshing .;4
8398;8412;153967;Yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .;1
7464;7478;138188;Ryan Gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted Daniel .;4
7862;7876;144991;The faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of V.S. Naipaul 's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour .;2

7711;7725;142370;The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .;0
7628;7642;140888;A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .;0

7632;7646;140980;Acting can not be acted .;2
7925;7939;145976;Do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man 's body ?;2
7730;7744;142682;It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .;0
8026;8040;147771;Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .;0
8409;8423;154154;Zoom !;3
8194;8208;150596;We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .;0
8106;8120;149214;Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances .;4
8516;8532;155850;The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .;1
7591;7605;140164;Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .;0
7765;7779;143299;Maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .;0
8160;8174;150075;It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .;0
7859;7873;144974;It 's that painful .;0
8456;8471;154868;But no. .;1
8258;8272;151638;Hard , endearing , caring , warm .;4
7721;7735;142498;A work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry .;4
8218;8232;151009;Not everyone will welcome or accept The Trials of Henry Kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one .;3
7781;7795;143616;Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot .;2
8447;8462;154718;Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .;1
8185;8199;150469;The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .;0
7667;7681;141561;What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .;1
7468;7482;138233;While the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some Westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo ... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity .;3
8457;8472;154869;Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .;1
7628;7642;140888;A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .;0
8412;8426;154204;It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .;3
7908;7922;145745;In the end , there is n't much to it .;0
7977;7991;146868;If you love reading and\/or poetry , then by all means check it out .;3
7713;7727;142394;The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .;1
8066;8080;148494;The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .;1
7479;7493;138397;The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .;1
8181;8195;150415;There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .;2
8142;8156;149800;An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .;0
8358;8372;153287;Between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism .;3
8073;8087;148633;When compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , Davis ' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic .;4
7833;7847;144534;... built on the premise that middle-class Arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids .;1
7879;7893;145257;Claire is a terrific role for someone like Judd , who really ought to be playing villains .;3
8164;8178;150134;"No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .";0
8491;8506;155402;Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .;3
7735;7749;142781;A treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you 're a struggling nobody .;3
7635;7649;141018;What saves it ... and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist Alice .;3
7924;7938;145968;An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .;1
8022;8036;147670;too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .;0
8256;8270;151610;The film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor .;3
7590;7604;140129;Like other great documentaries ... this goes after one truth -LRB- the Ford administration 's complicity in tearing ` orphans ' from their mothers -RRB- and stumbles upon others even more compelling .;2
7743;7757;142913;Not as good as The Full Monty , but a really strong second effort .;3
7829;7843;144432;As broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , Frank Novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism .;3
8389;8403;153839;As self-aware movies go , Who is Cletis Tout ?;2
8517;8533;155877;Proves a servicable World War II drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem Hollywood too long has ignored .;3

7690;7704;142001;Unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling .;3
8031;8045;147847;The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .;2
8243;8257;151420;I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .;1
7664;7678;141521;Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is .;0
7477;7491;138354;The byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , Carmen -LRB- Vega -RRB- and Juni -LRB- Sabara -RRB- Cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take .;4
8426;8440;154405;Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .;1
7496;7510;138617;Moretti plays Giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy .;2
8040;8054;147979;The charming result is Festival in Cannes .;3
8130;8144;149620;How I Killed My Father would be a rarity in Hollywood .;2
8288;8302;152164;... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .;0
7622;7636;140747;Although it does n't always hang together -- violence and whimsy do n't combine easily -- `` Cherish '' certainly is n't dull .;2
8051;8065;148201;On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .;1
8431;8446;154488;... by the time it 's done with us , Mira Nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over .;4
8009;8023;147441;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .;2
7996;8010;147214;Even when he 's not at his most critically insightful , Godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work .;3
8343;8357;153051;... a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department .;4
8470;8485;155041;Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .;3
7551;7565;139462;Just plain bad .;0
8364;8378;153381;Imagine Kevin Smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .;0
7745;7759;142933;The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . ';0
7704;7718;142251;Impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than Monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .;4
8438;8453;154598;Maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .;4
8112;8126;149309;With its hint of an awkward Hitchcockian theme in tact , Harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone;2
8488;8503;155349;If you open yourself up to Mr. Reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change .;3
8104;8118;149181;Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .;2
7734;7748;142757;I ca n't remember the last time I saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there 's only one problem ... it 's supposed to be a drama .;2
7552;7566;139464;It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors .;4
7756;7770;143141;A melancholy , emotional film .;2
7893;7907;145462;By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .;0
8483;8498;155246;The culmination of everyone 's efforts is given life when A Selection appears in its final form -LRB- in `` Last Dance '' -RRB- .;2
8038;8052;147943;By and large this is Mr. Kilmer 's movie , and it 's his strongest performance since The Doors .;3
8217;8231;150989;Though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the Kissinger should be tried as a war criminal .;1
7676;7690;141738;Tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of Yasujiro Ozu .;2
8199;8213;150678;The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .;0
7759;7773;143185;A bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events .;3
7846;7860;144793;Runs on the pure adrenalin of Pacino 's performance .;4
8347;8361;153109;If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .;0
7909;7923;145751;It makes me feel weird \/ Thinking about all the bad things in the world \/ Like puppies with broken legs \/ And butterflies that die \/ And movies starring pop queens;1
7671;7685;141662;Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting .;4
7604;7618;140374;The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .;2
8260;8274;151662;Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .;0
7750;7764;143031;Enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you 've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse .;3
7673;7687;141704;The Paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final -LRB- restored -RRB- third ... emotionally belittle a cinema classic .;0
8485;8500;155278;Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .;0
7510;7524;138820;The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .;2
7731;7745;142702;Morvern rocks .;4
8082;8096;148811;Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .;0
7660;7674;141443;A movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of Cho 's fans .;3
8163;8177;150113;Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .;0
7678;7692;141775;The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -LRB- the characters ' -RRB- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .;1
8385;8399;153755;-LRB- Haynes ' -RRB- homage to such films as `` All That Heaven Allows '' and `` Imitation of Life '' transcends them .;2
7778;7792;143554;One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before .;1
8224;8238;151117;Although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .;2
8020;8034;147625;A delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional .;4
8294;8308;152262;Priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .;0
8236;8250;151322;As gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting .;4
8070;8084;148569;No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .;0
8523;8539;155964;The French director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .;0
8311;8325;152561;Poignant and funny .;3
8133;8147;149665;Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would .;1
8089;8103;148945;Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .;0
7727;7741;142588;Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .;1
7538;7552;139286;The best comedy concert movie I 've seen since Cho 's previous concert comedy film , I 'm the One That I Want , in 2000 .;4
7546;7560;139415;A classy , sprightly spin on film .;4
7555;7569;139525;It is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters .;4
7811;7825;144149;If you 're willing to have fun with it , you wo n't feel cheated by the high infidelity of Unfaithful .;3
8421;8435;154332;A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .;1
8043;8057;148021;Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .;2
8493;8508;155428;As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .;0
8436;8451;154568;Weird .;1
7799;7813;143953;A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .;1
7580;7594;139969;How about surprising us by trying something new ?;0
8002;8016;147312;Romantic comedy and Dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here .;4
8187;8201;150495;Thumbs up to Paxton for not falling into the Hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer .;4
7769;7783;143392;Ash Wednesday is not Edward Burns ' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film .;3
7557;7571;139550;The cast ... keeps this pretty watchable , and casting Mick Jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .;3
7481;7495;138424;Just dreadful .;0
7712;7726;142378;The production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other .;4
7917;7931;145870;Brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , Haneke 's portrait of an upper class Austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .;4
7702;7716;142229;An ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .;1
8233;8247;151276;A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters .;3
8212;8226;150898;Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham .;4
7602;7616;140327;The tonal shifts are jolting , and though Wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .;2
8308;8322;152507;The message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .;2
8043;8057;148021;Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .;2
8059;8073;148354;Although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five Filipino-Americans and their frantic efforts to find love .;2
7562;7576;139649;An entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans .;3
7643;7657;141166;This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .;1
7558;7572;139569;Mildly amusing .;2
7553;7567;139476;A fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system;4
8158;8172;150032;There 's no good answer to that one .;1
8490;8505;155394;It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .;3
8495;8510;155472;It never rises to its clever what-if concept .;1
7698;7712;142158;Dramas like this make it human .;4
8226;8240;151144;The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .;0
8420;8434;154323;The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .;2
7952;7966;146435;Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .;1
8519;8535;155912;In this case zero .;1
8258;8272;151638;Hard , endearing , caring , warm .;4
8235;8249;151318;Good , solid storytelling .;4
8414;8428;154252;That 's its first sign of trouble .;1
8466;8481;155001;Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .;1
8056;8070;148284;What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .;0
8326;8340;152818;Snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good .;2
7962;7976;146623;Kinnear and Dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers .;4

7921;7935;145929;Allen 's funniest and most likeable movie in years .;4
8402;8416;154056;Gondry 's direction is adequate ... but what gives Human Nature its unique feel is Kaufman 's script .;3
8399;8413;153987;The film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring Kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity .;2
8307;8321;152488;The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .;1
8514;8529;155819;The underworld urban angst is derivative of Martin Scorsese 's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .;3
8368;8382;153461;harmlessly;3
8328;8342;152849;The Sweetest Thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways .;2

8154;8168;149978;After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .;0
7616;7630;140616;By no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story .;1
8367;8381;153442;The best way to describe it is as a cross between Paul Thomas Anderson 's Magnolia and David Lynch 's Mulholland Dr.;2
8413;8427;154227;More mature than Fatal Attraction , more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 Weeks , Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .;4

8440;8455;154637;And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .;1

7935;7949;146167;Japanese director Shohei Imamura 's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime .;3
8262;8276;151684;Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .;1
7901;7915;145602;Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .;0
8446;8461;154697;-LRB- Taylor -RRB- takes us on a ride that 's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .;2
7684;7698;141900;Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .;0
7537;7551;139280;A pleasant piece of escapist entertainment .;4
8461;8476;154926;The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .;1
8208;8222;150839;`` On Guard ! '';2
8246;8260;151461;Cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy .;2

7866;7880;145063;Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance;0
8048;8062;148142;... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !;0
7858;7872;144969;Meant for Star Wars fans .;2
8502;8517;155613;Campbell Scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of Roger Swanson .;3

7704;7718;142251;Impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than Monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .;4
8469;8484;155028;It made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters .;3
7926;7940;145993;How good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not .;3
7732;7746;142704;Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .;2
8494;8509;155451;The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .;3
8061;8075;148403;Brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as Bond in Die Another Day .;4
7839;7853;144689;The power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing did n't get our moral hackles up .;2

7568;7582;139731;Too bad none of it is funny .;0
8431;8446;154488;... by the time it 's done with us , Mira Nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over .;4
7876;7890;145192;A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .;1
8279;8293;151963;These three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people .;4
7746;7760;142958;If you like quirky , odd movies and\/or the ironic , here 's a fun one .;4
7870;7884;145111;A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .;1
8481;8496;155177;` Moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . ';1

7758;7772;143175;Rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning .;0
7655;7669;141374;A finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere .;4
7897;7911;145519;Plays like a checklist of everything Rob Reiner and his cast were sending up .;2
8282;8296;152035;In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24\/7 .;0
7708;7722;142329;Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .;0
8340;8354;152997;A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .;1
7990;8004;147059;LaBute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .;4
7779;7793;143570;Oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition .;2
8292;8306;152224;The sheer dumbness of the plot -LRB- other than its one good idea -RRB- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .;0
7729;7743;142663;So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .;0
8278;8292;151946;The film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .;3
7680;7694;141826;At its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood .;2
8113;8127;149341;The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .;0
8245;8259;151445;... would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie 's edges .;2
7694;7708;142077;Captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper .;3
7573;7587;139800;The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . ';2
8020;8034;147625;A delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional .;4
7814;7828;144213;Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice .;2
8438;8453;154598;Maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .;4
8197;8211;150642;This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .;0
8505;8520;155667;Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB- excepting Love Hewitt -RRB- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .;3
7513;7527;138874;The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .;0

8266;8280;151744;But I had a lot of problems with this movie .;1
7982;7996;146923;The biggest problem with this movie is that it 's not nearly long enough .;2
8357;8371;153272;It gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .;2
7552;7566;139464;It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors .;4
8324;8338;152789;The movie should be credited with remembering his victims .;2
8339;8353;152988;Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .;2
8219;8233;151035;It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .;0
7973;7987;146798;If you can read the subtitles -LRB- the opera is sung in Italian -RRB- and you like ` Masterpiece Theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie .;3
7577;7591;139933;The film has a kind of hard , cold effect .;1
7632;7646;140980;Acting can not be acted .;2
7523;7537;139047;A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .;0
7897;7911;145519;Plays like a checklist of everything Rob Reiner and his cast were sending up .;2
8033;8047;147881;The engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion .;3
7495;7509;138602;An engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character .;4
8334;8348;152930;High Crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it ca n't help but engage an audience .;3
7666;7680;141552;Marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula .;3
7512;7526;138871;Generic thriller junk .;0
8527;8543;156032;The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .;1
7785;7799;143695;Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .;1
7512;7526;138871;Generic thriller junk .;0
7720;7734;142480;A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .;1
8209;8223;150844;Average , at best , I 'm afraid .;1
7530;7544;139163;Spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don ' t know an Orc from a Uruk-Hai .;4
7698;7712;142158;Dramas like this make it human .;4
7490;7504;138540;Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .;1
7771;7785;143435;Lan Yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece .;1
8501;8516;155594;Williams creates a stunning , Taxi Driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity .;4
8181;8195;150415;There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .;2
8041;8055;147984;`` Home Movie '' is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book .;2
7621;7635;140718;Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .;1
7665;7679;141544;Suffers from a flat script and a low budget .;1
7928;7942;146035;With Dirty Deeds , David Caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen .;4
7685;7699;141935;Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .;1
7554;7568;139494;The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .;0
8289;8303;152189;... a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor .;2
7639;7653;141083;This enthralling documentary ... is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends .;4
8136;8150;149707;A thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions .;4
8522;8538;155950;It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .;3
8168;8182;150205;It does n't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain .;1
7915;7929;145834;It 's definitely an improvement on the first Blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously .;3
7951;7965;146426;Mendes still does n't quite know how to fill a frame .;1
8468;8483;155024;A ragbag of cliches .;0
7825;7839;144385;This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .;0
8333;8347;152911;A rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .;4
8498;8513;155528;A gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost .;4
8386;8400;153775;Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .;0
7788;7802;143757;Rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust .;3
7584;7598;140025;Most folks with a real stake in the American sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant .;2
7976;7990;146853;A mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in .;4
8296;8310;152287;Warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message .;4
8070;8084;148569;No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .;0
7673;7687;141704;The Paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final -LRB- restored -RRB- third ... emotionally belittle a cinema classic .;0
8207;8221;150825;We get an image of Big Papa spanning history , rather than suspending it .;2
7824;7838;144365;smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - Broadway play .;4
7763;7777;143258;More concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , Soderbergh 's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .;4
7580;7594;139969;How about surprising us by trying something new ?;0
8437;8452;154569;Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .;4
8096;8110;149065;Visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying .;2
7928;7942;146035;With Dirty Deeds , David Caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen .;4
7653;7667;141340;Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .;2
7584;7598;140025;Most folks with a real stake in the American sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant .;2
8300;8314;152362;It 's such a mechanical endeavor -LRB- that -RRB- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .;1
8388;8402;153825;A good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold .;3
7912;7926;145809;It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .;3
8023;8037;147698;A flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .;2
8477;8492;155136;Tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme does n't drag an audience down .;3
8242;8256;151418;Big time .;2
7847;7861;144803;Borstal Boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .;0
7929;7943;146074;But the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes .;4
8384;8398;153747;The material and the production itself are little more than routine .;1
7534;7548;139249;Surprisingly powerful and universal .;4
8441;8456;154658;The kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati .;4
7720;7734;142480;A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .;1
8118;8132;149408;Like The Full Monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .;4
7770;7784;143404;It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .;0
7878;7892;145227;Armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect Forster to the always hilarious Meara and Levy , Like Mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud .;4
8507;8522;155700;Exhilarating , funny and fun .;4
7923;7937;145965;Well-meaning but inert .;2
7615;7629;140593;Yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack ... and his chemistry with Shimizu is very believable .;4
8439;8454;154612;The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .;2
7531;7545;139183;Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .;2
8180;8194;150394;It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .;0
8189;8203;150531;Together -LRB- Time Out and Human Resources -RRB- establish Mr. Cantet as France 's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace .;3
8314;8328;152601;The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .;4
7701;7715;142184;The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .;2
7687;7701;141985;Although I did n't hate this one , it 's not very good either .;1
7518;7532;138953;A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .;2
7511;7525;138830;It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .;1
7971;7985;146757;This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .;1
7762;7776;143238;A breathtaking adventure for all ages , Spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images .;4
8506;8521;155694;A witty , whimsical feature debut .;3
8238;8252;151359;A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .;2
7515;7529;138902;Leaping from one arresting image to another , Songs from the Second Floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time .;4
8172;8186;150303;Like a can of 2-day old Coke .;0
7586;7600;140079;This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .;1
7516;7530;138934;Nothing about them is attractive .;1
8482;8497;155211;Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .;2
8032;8046;147864;The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles .;2
8193;8207;150585;The trappings of I Spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .;1
8231;8245;151228;While general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of Cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds .;4
7522;7536;139038;The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .;3
7706;7720;142303;Just a Kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people .;2
7765;7779;143299;Maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .;0
7659;7673;141436;Slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot .;2
7492;7506;138565;`` Simone '' is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality .;4
8528;8544;156040;The film is darkly atmospheric , with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst 's forced avuncular chortles .;2
7954;7968;146474;Still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin .;2
8125;8139;149526;I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .;0
8092;8106;148978;The art demands live viewing .;3
7927;7941;146015;For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -LRB- sci-fi -RRB- rehash .;1
8087;8101;148897;The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .;1
7965;7979;146670;The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -LRB- of which they 'll get plenty -RRB- fills me with revulsion .;0

8459;8474;154896;A new film from Bill Plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .;4
8135;8149;149698;At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .;1
8178;8192;150374;The Lady and the Duke is Eric Rohmer 's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama;2
8204;8218;150764;It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .;3

7464;7478;138188;Ryan Gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted Daniel .;4
7904;7918;145650;some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and;3
8405;8419;154102;Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .;1
8459;8474;154896;A new film from Bill Plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .;4
7553;7567;139476;A fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system;4
8386;8400;153775;Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .;0
7630;7644;140954;The innocence of holiday cheer ai n't what it used to be .;2
7947;7961;146371;Ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?;1
7740;7754;142870;Bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie .;2
7545;7559;139403;The movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .;2
7658;7672;141431;It 's just a little too self-satisfied .;2

7624;7638;140785;Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .;0
7993;8007;147134;A film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in San Diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times I saw the film .;4
7618;7632;140665;At its worst , it 's Rambo - meets-John Ford .;2
8253;8267;151551;It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .;1
7843;7857;144756;`` Frailty '' has been written so well , that even a simple `` Goddammit ! '';3
8018;8032;147601;There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .;0

7744;7758;142925;A penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic .;2
8480;8495;155176;Disgusting .;0

7793;7807;143840;After one gets the feeling that the typical Hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it 's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of Zishe and the fiery presence of Hanussen .;3
7527;7541;139115;The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .;1
8196;8210;150636;But the actors make this worth a peek .;3
7620;7634;140706;It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .;0
7502;7516;138691;Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .;1
8131;8145;149626;The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .;2
8367;8381;153442;The best way to describe it is as a cross between Paul Thomas Anderson 's Magnolia and David Lynch 's Mulholland Dr.;2

7981;7995;146909;The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .;0
7852;7866;144866;In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .;0
8079;8093;148762;A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .;4
7987;8001;146995;One of those so-so films that could have been much better .;1

7839;7853;144689;The power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing did n't get our moral hackles up .;2
8408;8422;154151;The acting is n't much better .;0
8133;8147;149665;Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would .;1
7600;7614;140294;Not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet .;3
7653;7667;141340;Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .;2
8333;8347;152911;A rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .;4
7707;7721;142319;Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .;2
7856;7870;144917;Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .;2
8126;8140;149543;Gambling and throwing a basketball game for money is n't a new plot -- in fact Toback himself used it in Black and White .;2

8224;8238;151117;Although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .;2
8021;8035;147654;... the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material .;1
7885;7899;145356;The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for Gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other Carmen before her .;3
8223;8237;151099;An oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion .;3
8186;8200;150486;About as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come .;4
8249;8263;151501;Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .;0
8063;8077;148425;Thirteen Conversations About One Thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a Mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .;3

8068;8082;148533;Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .;0
7823;7837;144347;Weaver and LaPaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .;4
