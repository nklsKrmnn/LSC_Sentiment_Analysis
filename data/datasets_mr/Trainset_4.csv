3363;3366;66375;The thing just never gets off the ground .;0
3330;3333;65741;It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .;0

4000;4003;77827;Although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of Spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching .;3

3909;3912;76239;Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .;1
4055;4059;78866;The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .;0

3373;3376;66513;Klein , charming in comedies like American Pie and dead-on in Election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .;1

3278;3281;64789;Contrived as this may sound , Mr. Rose 's updating works surprisingly well .;3
4109;4113;79818;It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .;1

3682;3685;72146;The actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect .;2

3946;3949;76778;Try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of Kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment .;4
3341;3344;65926;It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .;1
3862;3865;75344;Worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film .;3
3565;3568;70068;Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .;1
4164;4168;80855;This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .;1
3866;3869;75459;Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .;0

3557;3560;69972;Surprisingly insightful;3
3757;3760;73549;I realized that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked , its story was making no sense at all .;2
4243;4247;82276;No , I love it ... hell , I dunno .;3
3908;3911;76214;As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .;0
3543;3546;69710;Going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it 's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it 's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through .;2
4159;4163;80799;Faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , `` A Walk to Remember '' succeeds through sincerity .;3
4081;4085;79320;even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .;1
3657;3660;71721;Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .;3

4203;4207;81573;Despite bearing the Paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement European pickup .;0

4189;4193;81346;-LRB- Breheny 's -RRB- lensing of the New Zealand and Cook Island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people .;4
3468;3471;68394;Even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough .;2
3489;3492;68729;It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .;2
3449;3452;68010;Others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find Morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating .;4
4204;4208;81589;All in all , Brown Sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted .;4
3877;3880;75680;Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .;2

3451;3454;68061;Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .;1
4144;4148;80524;A frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it 's a tougher picture than it is .;2
4020;4023;78181;It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .;0

3386;3389;66783;But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .;1
3270;3273;64653;One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .;1
3726;3729;73012;Always destined to be measured against Anthony Asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .;3

4256;4260;82508;The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson ...;4
3258;3261;64410;A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .;2
3562;3565;70020;I found The Ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .;3
3600;3603;70673;Stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid .;4
3384;3387;66741;Driven by a fantastic dual performance from Ian Holm ... the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs .;4
3803;3806;74292;Fulford-Wierzbicki ... deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen .;3
4214;4218;81766;A hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic French nuance .;2
3225;3228;63762;A waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .;1
3324;3327;65649;Peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .;2
3891;3894;75893;... Wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving War Department telegrams .;3
3344;3347;65974;This submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to Das Boot .;3
3817;3820;74503;Although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , `` Orange County '' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be .;3
4220;4224;81863;Though a touch too Arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , Heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .;3
4140;4144;80433;Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .;2
3953;3956;76933;Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .;0
3966;3969;77149;The attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way .;3
3490;3493;68739;It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but Olympia , Wash. , based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting .;3
3790;3793;74089;Mr. Deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way .;4

3938;3941;76635;Combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why did n't Hollywood think of this sooner ?;3
4152;4156;80681;An unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture .;3
4182;4186;81222;Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .;1
3804;3807;74301;This is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it 's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men .;3
4193;4197;81404;An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .;2
4246;4250;82325;Like these Russo guys lookin ' for their Mamet instead found their Sturges .;2
3506;3509;69095;Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .;0

3458;3461;68176;The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .;1
4139;4143;80405;It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more .;4
3999;4002;77814;Strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency .;3
3629;3632;71172;Because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin .;4

3632;3635;71219;"The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .";0
4263;4267;82637;This makes Minority Report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever .;4
3378;3381;66616;Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .;0
3520;3523;69283;Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .;1
4043;4047;78630;A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .;1
3806;3809;74339;While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .;1
4235;4239;82149;The performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye .;3
3795;3798;74147;Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .;1
3500;3503;68959;Despite Besson 's high-profile name being Wasabi 's big selling point , there is no doubt that Krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film 's thoroughly winning tone .;3
3713;3716;72749;A fun family movie that 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , ` It 's never too late to believe in your dreams . ';4
4209;4213;81663;The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .;0
3363;3366;66375;The thing just never gets off the ground .;0
3630;3633;71194;As a vehicle to savour Binoche 's skill , the film is well worthwhile .;4

3382;3385;66694;Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .;0
3551;3554;69881;On its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny .;3

3989;3992;77611;While somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you 've got to hand it to director George Clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out .;3
4116;4120;79974;Gere gives a good performance in a film that does n't merit it .;2
3422;3425;67468;Gloriously straight from the vagina .;2

3748;3751;73384;It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .;0
3261;3264;64476;The charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids .;3

4236;4240;82164;A rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means .;3
3330;3333;65741;It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .;0
4088;4092;79443;It 's Jagger 's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite .;2

3965;3968;77141;A glossy knock-off of a B-movie revenge flick .;2
3823;3826;74605;While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .;1

3660;3663;71792;It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .;0
4217;4221;81791;Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .;1

4184;4188;81243;Exciting and well-paced .;4
3302;3305;65282;This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .;0

4118;4122;80003;The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .;0

3546;3549;69777;By the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better .;2
3822;3825;74591;A fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .;4
3505;3508;69047;It 's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .;3
3972;3975;77258;Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .;2

3535;3538;69586;Nevertheless , it still seems endless .;1
3487;3490;68681;For a film that 's being advertised as a comedy , Sweet Home Alabama is n't as funny as you 'd hoped .;1
3258;3261;64410;A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .;2
3693;3696;72326;The filmmakers lack the nerve ... to fully exploit the script 's potential for sick humor .;2
3199;3202;63295;An effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work .;4

3845;3848;75035;Scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky .;4

3831;3834;74787;-LRB- Reno -RRB- delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion .;3
4137;4141;80365;I ca n't say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .;1
3529;3532;69474;Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original .;2
4260;4264;82591;Writer-director David Jacobson and his star , Jeremy Renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .;4
3308;3311;65381;The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .;0
4013;4016;78013;A visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .;1
3385;3388;66767;While the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work .;3
3776;3779;73889;Amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than Barbershop .;4
3510;3513;69136;She may not be real , but the laughs are .;4
3629;3632;71172;Because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by Kieran Culkin .;4
3672;3675;71950;I love the robust middle of this picture .;4
3524;3527;69371;... an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller .;4
3832;3835;74812;The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .;1
3993;3996;77700;This is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .;2
3423;3426;67474;The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .;0
3704;3707;72542;-LRB- Leigh -RRB- has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors -LRB- improvised over many months -RRB- and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable .;4

3683;3686;72159;The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .;3
4101;4105;79720;Plus , like I already mentioned ... it 's Robert Duvall !;3
4124;4128;80117;The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .;0

3956;3959;76980;preachy and;1
4041;4045;78598;A whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish .;3
4263;4267;82637;This makes Minority Report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever .;4

3232;3235;63924;Abderrahmane Sissako 's Heremakono -LRB- Waiting for Happiness -RRB- is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the West African coast struggling against foreign influences .;2
3440;3443;67790;The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .;3
4047;4051;78732;Bad and baffling from the get-go .;0
3587;3590;70429;A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .;1
3235;3238;64013;Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .;1

3596;3599;70591;The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .;1
3245;3248;64175;While kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .;2
4136;4140;80356;... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .;0
4003;4006;77871;Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .;0
4017;4020;78103;It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .;0
3750;3753;73429;it 's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original .;4
3742;3745;73311;This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .;0
3326;3329;65676;All comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad .;0
3584;3587;70383;A solid , psychological action film from Hong Kong .;3
3226;3229;63772;The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .;1

3933;3936;76547;A preposterous , prurient whodunit .;0
3705;3708;72578;Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .;1
3355;3358;66232;Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .;1
4074;4078;79178;Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .;1
3770;3773;73769;Largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .;2
4012;4015;77998;Evelyn 's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn .;3
3515;3518;69221;The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .;1
3522;3525;69328;In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , The Emperor 's Club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .;1
4197;4201;81465;It 's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old Ferris Bueller .;4
3252;3255;64287;For those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half .;4
3384;3387;66741;Driven by a fantastic dual performance from Ian Holm ... the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs .;4
3958;3961;77005;Polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own World War II experience in his signature style .;4
3624;3627;71090;The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .;0

3610;3613;70873;Some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .;2
4026;4029;78313;Like Brosnan 's performance , Evelyn comes from the heart .;4
4244;4248;82286;It 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter .;4
3200;3203;63302;This is a movie you can trust .;4
3868;3871;75501;A heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist .;4
3670;3673;71926;Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...;0
3390;3393;66875;Contradicts everything we 've come to expect from movies nowadays .;3

3880;3883;75743;What 's most refreshing about Real Women Have Curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors .;3
3837;3840;74901;It 's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters .;1
3932;3935;76534;The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .;2
3364;3367;66382;Who is this movie for ?;2

3712;3715;72723;What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence .;2

3401;3404;67054;Nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book .;3

4218;4222;81820;That frenetic spectacle -LRB- on the TV show -RRB- has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout .;1
3751;3754;73450;Its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work .;3
3241;3244;64112;The charm of Revolution OS is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers .;3
3573;3576;70222;I ca n't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ...;0

4113;4117;79911;A poignant lyricism runs through Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem .;4
3828;3831;74719;Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .;0

3636;3639;71341;A colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded .;4

3982;3985;77477;John Carlen 's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .;2
3845;3848;75035;Scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky .;4
3766;3769;73689;This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .;0
4070;4074;79107;The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .;1
3728;3731;73053;There is greatness here .;4
3503;3506;69009;Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .;1
3724;3727;72970;It 's the perfect star vehicle for Grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona .;3
4046;4050;78703;In the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director Roger Kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags .;1

3801;3804;74253;Other than a mildly engaging central romance , Hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .;0
3240;3243;64100;The funny thing is , I did n't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit .;2
3437;3440;67728;Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about;1

3208;3211;63456;The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .;3
3660;3663;71792;It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .;0

3861;3864;75315;Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .;1
4208;4212;81638;The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .;2
3297;3300;65192;... while Dark Water is n't a complete wash -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- , watched side-by-side with Ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor .;1
4139;4143;80405;It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more .;4
3967;3970;77167;Full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , Time Out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life .;1
3339;3342;65886;What might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .;1

3812;3815;74450;Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .;4
3944;3947;76745;Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .;0

3476;3479;68541;Gangster No. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .;4

4174;4178;81064;Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .;2
3407;3410;67196;Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond Road Warrior , it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .;3
