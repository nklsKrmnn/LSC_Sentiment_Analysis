6529;6539;121968;It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .;0
6880;6891;128089;A movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts .;-1
7191;7203;133496;For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .;-1
6596;6606;123065;It 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon .;0
6448;6458;120721;It 's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens ' grandeur .;1
6663;6674;124269;Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .;-1
6673;6684;124417;For those who like quirky , slightly strange French films , this is a must !;1
6970;6982;129738;... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .;-1
6520;6530;121855;An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .;-1
7421;7434;137403;Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .;-1
7318;7331;135669;Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .;0
7283;7295;135144;It is n't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems .;0
6587;6597;122943;Humor in I Spy is so anemic .;-1
7181;7193;133313;This comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative .;1
7277;7289;135026;Who is the audience for Cletis Tout ?;0
6924;6936;128981;I 'm guessing the director is a magician .;1
7275;7287;135009;Has its charming quirks and its dull spots .;0
7151;7163;132838;The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .;0
6417;6427;120192;A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .;-1
7390;7403;136877;Craig Bartlett and director Tuck Tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters .;1
7097;7109;131859;Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .;1
6712;6723;125100;Beautifully directed and convincingly acted .;1
7053;7065;131101;And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .;0
7252;7264;134609;It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .;-1
7401;7414;137061;A wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a Mrs. Robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .;-1
7225;7237;134092;The film 's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls ' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that 's opened between them .;1
7241;7253;134453;The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .;-1
6507;6517;121591;There 's nothing like love to give a movie a B-12 shot , and CQ shimmers with it .;1
7121;7133;132297;Serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that The Road to Perdition leads to a satisfying destination .;1
7352;7365;136233;Some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .;0
6940;6952;129276;Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .;0
6502;6512;121540;A lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world .;1
7441;7454;137721;For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown .;-1
7314;7327;135625;While American Adobo has its heart -LRB- and its palate -RRB- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .;-1
6917;6929;128810;If you 're part of her targeted audience , you 'll cheer .;1
6979;6991;129850;The results are far more alienating than involving .;-1
7387;7400;136807;Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .;-1
7248;7260;134569;It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose .;1
7187;7199;133407;We do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close .;-1
6483;6493;121245;While not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the National Lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy .;1
7073;7085;131488;Boy oh boy , it 's a howler .;0
6776;6787;126253;If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .;0
6836;6847;127301;The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for Damon\/Bourne or his predicament .;-1
7149;7161;132805;For all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between Sullivan and his son .;1
7011;7023;130362;Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .;-1
6693;6704;124748;Much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of Stuart and Margolo .;1
6754;6765;125924;If you want to see a train wreck that you ca n't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .;0
6920;6932;128874;Ong chooses to present Ah Na 's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character 's blank-faced optimism .;0
6923;6935;128947;The film 's strength is n't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears .;1
6475;6485;121089;A Rumor of Angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .;-1
7056;7068;131140;Overall , it 's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .;0
6558;6568;122471;Spain 's greatest star wattage does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .;-1
6517;6527;121801;Parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil;0
7354;7367;136266;Entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from Venus and men from Mars can indeed get together .;0
7180;7192;133284;For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture;0
7425;7438;137456;The plot of the comeback curlers is n't very interesting actually , but what I like about Men With Brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what 's unique and quirky about Canadians .;1
7026;7038;130627;But the performances of Pacino , Williams , and Swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through .;1
6922;6934;128937;If you 're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse .;1
6981;6993;129882;Neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest Attal and Gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .;1
6453;6463;120779;... the film 's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . ';-1
7088;7100;131707;A listless and desultory affair .;-1
7409;7422;137215;The movie is brilliant , really .;1
6687;6698;124643;A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .;-1
6451;6461;120744;Last Dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that 's true .;0
7154;7166;132901;It 's not too much of anything .;-1
6573;6583;122691;It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .;0
6669;6680;124366;It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .;-1
7180;7192;133284;For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture;0
7120;7132;132286;There 's something about a marching band that gets me where I live .;0
7361;7374;136386;A surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of Hollywood 's comic-book adaptations .;1
7093;7105;131804;Wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message .;1
7302;7314;135420;Halloween : Resurrection is n't exactly quality cinema , but it is n't nearly as terrible as it cold have been .;0
7279;7291;135066;Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .;-1
6903;6914;128532;The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .;-1
7199;7211;133671;Think of it as Gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch .;1
7123;7135;132329;Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .;-1

7066;7078;131351;The inevitable double - and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .;0
6560;6570;122488;That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .;-1
7070;7082;131443;A mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama .;1
7136;7148;132558;Talk To Her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it 's still quite worth seeing .;1
7434;7447;137645;This is SO De Palma .;0
7014;7026;130409;It 's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual Spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team .;1
7458;7471;138090;Cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective .;1
6627;6637;123590;An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension .;0
7226;7238;134120;Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .;-1
7455;7468;138056;How this one escaped the Lifetime network I 'll never know .;-1
7357;7370;136317;A respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain Trek films ... cross over to a more mainstream audience .;0
6940;6952;129276;Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .;0
6567;6577;122607;At the film 's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , Michel Piccoli .;0
6912;6924;128715;A bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract Frank Tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist 's career .;0
6496;6506;121443;A competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country .;1
7406;7419;137173;This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .;-1

7287;7299;135200;There are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but Brown Sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy .;0

7417;7430;137303;Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .;-1

6567;6577;122607;At the film 's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , Michel Piccoli .;0

6546;6556;122312;Despite the pyrotechnics , Narc is strictly by the book .;0
6480;6490;121203;The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .;-1
7384;7397;136767;That is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .;0
6797;6808;126609;Director-writer Bille August ... depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey Martin 's deterioration and Barbara 's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger .;0
6849;6860;127511;It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .;1
7405;7418;137141;Trailer park Magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all .;0
6706;6717;124972;A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .;1
6652;6662;124076;The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .;-1

6773;6784;126221;A different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know .;1
7022;7034;130549;Serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .;0
6935;6947;129188;As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music .;-1
6941;6953;129300;The film 's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter .;1
7355;7368;136288;A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .;0
6765;6776;126106;A penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination .;1
6828;6839;127172;The Movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance .;1
7309;7321;135554;The all-French cast is marveilleux .;1
6629;6639;123623;Dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart .;0
6747;6758;125790;There 's no question that Epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .;0
7088;7100;131707;A listless and desultory affair .;-1
7090;7102;131737;This time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part .;1
7186;7198;133387;A worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions .;1
6453;6463;120779;... the film 's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . ';-1
6487;6497;121321;Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .;-1
6584;6594;122912;The sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack .;1
7028;7040;130670;There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made A Walk to Remember a niche hit .;1
6491;6501;121364;It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .;0
7454;7467;138034;Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .;0
6591;6601;122973;Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .;-1
6927;6939;129016;It 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor .;1
7333;7346;135987;I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .;-1

7280;7292;135087;But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .;-1
6853;6864;127606;A different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling .;0
6984;6996;129948;Has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together .;0
7032;7044;130753;Leaks treacle from every pore .;-1
7269;7281;134899;Humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way .;0
7003;7015;130246;An indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh .;1
6777;6788;126285;Red Dragon is less baroque and showy than Hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than Silence .;0
7436;7449;137651;Overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances .;1
7205;7217;133748;The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .;0
7116;7128;132208;A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .;-1
6509;6519;121625;At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it;-1
7103;7115;131989;Nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .;-1
7343;7356;136124;Woody Allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody .;1
6838;6849;127360;Arty gay film .;0
6420;6430;120251;Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?;-1
6617;6627;123437;Drug abuse , infidelity and death are n't usually comedy fare , but Turpin 's film allows us to chuckle through the angst .;1
7323;7336;135796;If I have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story -LRB- like , say , Treasure Planet -RRB- or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , I 'll take the latter every time .;0
7053;7065;131101;And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .;0
6463;6473;120932;Wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .;0
6900;6911;128456;In many ways , reminiscent of 1992 's Unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue .;0
7018;7030;130460;Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -LRB- since Sept. 11 -RRB- .;-1
6905;6916;128567;Flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old Jack Nicholson could be looking at his 12th Oscar nomination by proving that he 's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary .;1
6531;6541;122031;The amazing film work is so convincing that by movies ' end you 'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others .;1
7083;7095;131639;In both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .;0
6403;6413;119904;This is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live .;-1
6994;7006;130081;The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .;-1
7024;7036;130573;An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .;-1
7250;7262;134587;This is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on Jerry Springer .;1
7346;7359;136160;A disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate IMAX trip .;-1
6684;6695;124598;Wow , a jump cut !;0
7006;7018;130287;A direct-to-void release , heading nowhere .;0
6541;6551;122189;Rarely have I seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart .;1
6754;6765;125924;If you want to see a train wreck that you ca n't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .;0
6873;6884;127970;I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .;-1
6790;6801;126476;The first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !;1
7008;7020;130304;Davis has energy , but she does n't bother to make her heroine 's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .;0
6537;6547;122159;Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever .;-1
6651;6661;124054;Might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people .;0

7243;7255;134486;I survived .;0
6732;6743;125489;The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .;0
6670;6681;124374;Bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love .;1
7457;7470;138077;By the standards of knucklehead swill , The Hot Chick is pretty damned funny .;1
6473;6483;121022;Disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , Tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself .;0
6511;6521;121682;Though it 's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of Evans ' saga of Hollywood excess .;1
7201;7213;133702;The Lady and the Duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the French Revolution from the aristocrats ' perspective .;1
6521;6531;121870;Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .;-1

7325;7338;135880;It 's a sight to behold .;0
7386;7399;136784;The film 's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations .;1

6590;6600;122967;Grown-up quibbles are beside the point here .;0

6653;6663;124107;"Has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .";0
6846;6857;127475;Cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in .;1
7371;7384;136580;It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .;0
6864;6875;127825;Neil Burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present .;1
6972;6984;129752;Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .;0
6529;6539;121968;It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .;0
6938;6950;129239;What 's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up .;-1
6686;6697;124622;Apparently writer-director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .;0
6510;6520;121669;The criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...;-1
6683;6694;124579;So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie .;0
7367;7380;136488;Affectionately reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things .;1
6881;6892;128102;I liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive .;1
7331;7344;135968;Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .;1
7069;7081;131433;One of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .;0
7352;7365;136233;Some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .;0
6572;6582;122663;Short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child 's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of Eudora Welty .;1
7327;7340;135891;A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching .;1
7055;7067;131121;There 's absolutely no reason why Blue Crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is;1
7062;7074;131256;A family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .;0
6952;6964;129505;The film 's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film 's production design .;0
6616;6626;123416;The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .;-1
6893;6904;128315;Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .;0
6666;6677;124322;The Piano Teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .;-1
7312;7324;135588;`` Looking For Leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .;-1
7437;7450;137662;Thriller directorial debut for Traffic scribe Gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces do n't quite fit together .;0
6559;6569;122483;Real Women Have Curves does n't offer any easy answers .;0
7144;7156;132734;After seeing ` Analyze That , ' I feel better already .;1
7253;7265;134622;You 'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you 'll laugh .;0
6942;6954;129324;It 's like an old Warner Bros. costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make , though Bette Davis , cast as Joan , would have killed him .;0
7261;7273;134754;Strange and beautiful film .;1
6470;6480;120993;... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .;-1
7110;7122;132083;The film 's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it 's propelled by the acting .;1
7001;7013;130230;This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .;-1
6593;6603;123030;Its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition .;0
