7657;4507;86932;It 's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .;1
7658;6767;125953;The message of such reflections -- intentional or not -- is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one .;2
7659;7549;139252;Features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .;0
7660;7656;141137;Directing with a sure and measured hand , -LRB- Haneke -RRB- steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .;3
7661;3188;62976;Hugh Grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in About a Boy .;4
7662;884;19925;Godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence .;4
7663;1233;26874;It is n't scary .;1
7664;5163;98496;There ai n't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it 's hilarious .;2
7665;3126;61835;The movie is our story as much as it is Schmidt 's , no matter if it 's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale .;2
7666;6680;124366;It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .;1
7667;5393;102460;The boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on Guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .;2
7668;2187;45040;Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .;2
7669;437;10371;Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .;1
7670;6226;116741;Using an endearing cast , writer\/director Dover Kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred .;3
7671;5704;107853;New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is .;0
7672;2888;57301;Though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of Brown 's life .;3
7673;8055;147984;`` Home Movie '' is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book .;2
7674;5588;105876;Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .;1
7675;2759;55325;There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .;1
7676;53;1446;Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .;0
7677;5615;106333;Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .;3
7678;444;10518;Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones .;3
7679;6733;125315;Wow .;3
7680;4258;82470;Suspend your disbelief here and now , or you 'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits .;1
7681;4884;93656;It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy , a kind of Elder Bueller 's Time Out .;3
7682;6397;119625;Has its share of arresting images .;2
7683;6547;122159;Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever .;0
7684;4781;91857;High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .;0

7686;8291;151935;Vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order .;2
7687;6024;113361;This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .;0
7688;3606;70749;and `` They 're coming ! '';2
7689;976;21806;An EXIT sign , that is .;1
7690;6848;127342;Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain .;2
7691;7378;136449;The casting of Raymond J. Barry as the ` assassin ' greatly enhances the quality of Neil Burger 's impressive fake documentary .;3
7692;2790;55792;... hypnotically dull .;0
7693;84;2218;Inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening .;3
7694;8419;154102;Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .;1
7695;2230;45840;Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .;0
7696;5905;111345;For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .;1
7697;1151;25176;Lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless .;2
7698;5481;103930;A must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle .;4
7699;3856;75173;-LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .;1
7700;8211;150642;This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .;0
7701;4127;80106;Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show .;3
7702;7824;144134;Comedy troupe Broken Lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot .;2
7703;817;18579;If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .;1
7704;1927;40190;The delicious trimmings ... arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability to triumph over a Scrooge or two .;4
7705;5945;111990;The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard -LRB- which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog -RRB- is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .;1
7706;1541;32888;It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .;3
7707;6298;117894;The film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of Juliette Binoche as Sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth .;3
7708;2027;42110;Australian actor\/director John Polson and award-winning English cinematographer Giles Nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation .;3
7709;7752;142832;If you 've got a house full of tots -- do n't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .;1

7712;4921;94294;Dense , exhilarating documentary .;3
7713;6681;124374;Bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love .;3
7714;2918;57885;But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .;2
7715;4786;91967;We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .;0
7716;8506;155402;Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .;3
7717;4039;78525;The film is all over the place , really .;0
7718;4932;94497;I liked a lot of the smaller scenes .;3
7719;1468;31401;At 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth .;4

7722;8297;152071;A delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by Michael Gondry .;4
7723;3250;64222;It 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing .;4
7724;4020;78103;It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .;0
7725;8519;155646;With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .;1
7726;4054;78767;You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .;1
7727;2387;48875;Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .;0
7728;5811;109670;Less than fresh .;1
7729;7463;137930;Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .;1
7730;4203;81494;As a science fiction movie , `` Minority Report '' astounds .;4
7731;5645;106883;While the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchie 's Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch has the bod , he 's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .;1
7732;1240;26987;The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .;1
7733;621;14413;It challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should .;3
7734;2059;42663;Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .;1
7735;2217;45615;Has its moments , but it 's pretty far from a treasure .;2
7736;3691;72230;The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .;1
7737;1074;23659;Strange it is , but delightfully so .;3
7738;6016;113231;A brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on Hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .;2
7739;3879;75665;Solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining .;1
7740;7854;144713;A sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception .;3
7741;6907;128375;Witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions .;3
7742;2622;52877;What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .;2
7743;6582;122663;Short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child 's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of Eudora Welty .;3

7747;1369;29550;Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .;0
7748;760;17528;From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .;4
7749;4825;92614;If horses could fly , this is surely what they 'd look like .;2
7750;3395;66895;Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .;2
7751;5020;96087;-LRB- Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are -RRB- sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .;1
7752;7883;145106;an admirable , sometimes exceptional film;4
7753;7170;132938;... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .;0
7754;4140;80356;... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .;0
7755;95;2473;Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .;0
7756;1936;40470;-LRB- Gulpilil -RRB- is a commanding screen presence , and his character 's abundant humanism makes him the film 's moral compass .;3
7757;4411;85297;Mandel Holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning .;2
7758;1719;36346;It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .;3
7759;4345;84121;Performances are potent , and the women 's stories are ably intercut and involving .;2
7760;5436;103094;A slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time .;4
7761;1948;40660;Real Women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way .;4
7762;4254;82366;But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .;1
7763;7065;131101;And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .;2
7764;3677;71975;As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .;3
7765;8166;149930;If you grew up on Scooby -- you 'll love this movie .;3
7766;7641;140877;A vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior .;3
7767;6048;113790;Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , Metropolis is a feast for the eyes .;4
7768;4171;80911;... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .;0
7769;2404;49179;It would be disingenuous to call Reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex .;2

7771;1706;36120;It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...;2
7772;1123;24651;The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .;1
7773;1978;41235;Sweet gentle Jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?;1
7774;3170;62656;The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but Ram Dass : Fierce Grace does n't organize it with any particular insight .;2

7776;7801;143741;Does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background .;3
7777;2122;43770;A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .;1
7778;106;2739;A macabre and very stylized Swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters .;3
7779;6153;115486;It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .;0
7780;8380;153435;Whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste .;2
7781;1506;32143;A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .;0
7782;7098;131699;Time Out is as serious as a pink slip .;1
7783;3357;66209;Resident Evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an MTV , sugar hysteria , and PlayStation cocktail .;1
7784;8129;149382;Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .;0
7785;7833;144274;A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .;1
7786;2523;51252;The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .;1
7787;824;18761;This Orange has some juice , but it 's far from fresh-squeezed .;1
7788;7937;145965;Well-meaning but inert .;2
7789;4263;82568;A much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director Anthony Friedman 's similarly updated 1970 British production .;3
7790;18;474;Like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to Mr. Wong 's In the Mood for Love -- very much a Hong Kong movie despite its mainland setting .;2
7791;7371;136341;A movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart .;4
7792;7383;136547;As is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , Mr. Murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold .;1
7793;4082;79266;The film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant .;4
7794;4994;95631;While the story 's undeniably hard to follow , Iwai 's gorgeous visuals seduce .;3
7795;3443;67790;The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .;3
7796;5354;101694;The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .;1
7797;6756;125740;Fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , Narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it .;4
7798;5299;100887;Sometimes this ` Blood ' seems as tired as its protagonist ... Still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game .;2
7799;7125;132163;A lovably old-school Hollywood confection .;3
7800;5080;97164;Director Lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .;4
7801;1435;30836;It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .;3
7802;4877;93542;A chick flick for guys .;2
7803;4828;92659;Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , -LRB- very -RRB- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -LRB- for Seagal -RRB- .;2
7804;8125;149305;An elegant and sly deadpan comedy .;3
7805;5248;100006;Has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .;1
7806;4042;78578;The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .;1
7807;8045;147847;The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .;2
7808;8118;149181;Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .;2

7810;4159;80733;There 's lots of cool stuff packed into ESPN 's Ultimate X.;3
7811;3098;61293;You 'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama .;3
7812;4374;84534;After all , it 'll probably be in video stores by Christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .;1
7813;6316;118241;It 's sweet .;3
7814;3150;62328;Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? '';1
7815;1876;39289;No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .;1
7816;3737;73169;Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .;0
7817;7810;143895;The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .;1
7818;7623;140465;Griffin & Co. manage to be spectacularly outrageous .;4
7819;7258;134535;Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle .;2
7820;5134;98003;Leigh makes these lives count .;3
7821;4559;87781;Tsai Ming-liang 's witty , wistful new film , What Time Is It There ?;3
7822;2929;58134;Both the crime story and the love story are unusual .;2
7823;3414;67279;Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .;1
7824;2602;52556;What 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle ?;2
7825;6229;116788;A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .;3
7826;3257;64339;But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences;0
7827;5109;97633;It did n't go straight to video .;2
7828;7453;137707;Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films .;1
7829;8541;155998;Despite these annoyances , the capable Clayburgh and Tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age .;2
7830;2162;44616;A beautiful , entertaining two hours .;4
7831;3815;74450;Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .;4

8041;3970;77167;Full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , Time Out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life .;1
8042;6240;116971;Then you 'd do well to check this one out because it 's straight up Twin Peaks action ...;3
8043;70;1883;A very funny romantic comedy about two skittish New York middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles .;3
8044;7004;130047;Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .;0
8045;3291;65022;This rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .;3
8046;3778;73854;We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .;0
8047;2147;44253;You do n't need to know your Ice-T 's from your Cool-J 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of California .;1
8048;304;7500;What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .;3
8049;4167;80851;A decidedly mixed bag .;2
8050;3;82;Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .;1
8051;5909;111403;An original little film about one young woman 's education .;2
8052;2556;51816;The most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland .;2

8054;2601;52539;Watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat .;3
8055;6071;114152;The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .;2
8056;7556;139361;You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .;1
8057;8353;152988;Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .;2
8058;5767;108936;With this masterful , flawless film , -LRB- Wang -RRB- emerges in the front ranks of China 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers .;4

8063;2013;41812;It picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film .;4
8064;1535;32736;Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .;2
8065;1025;22643;It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .;1
8066;445;10544;The concept is a hoot .;3

8074;7382;136530;The Chateau ... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .;1

8080;1475;31514;Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .;1
8081;61;1628;The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .;1
8082;754;17367;Less an examination of neo-Nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .;3
8083;3604;70696;You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .;2
8084;4926;94383;The movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing .;3
8085;1935;40466;... a pretentious mess ...;0
8086;3813;74399;Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .;2
8087;139;3687;The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .;0
8088;4638;89234;You 'll cry for your money back .;0

8116;6187;116075;What one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream .;3

8424;6772;126046;Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .;1
8425;7533;138990;Highly irritating at first , Mr. Koury 's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results .;2
8426;3087;61110;Elegant , mannered and teasing .;3
8427;3439;67705;This amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as Greenfingers ...;3
8428;4743;91174;Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout Maelstrom .;2
8429;7135;132329;Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .;1
8430;2347;48109;While some will object to the idea of a Vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , Soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation .;1
8431;1140;25006;And that is where Ararat went astray .;1
8432;6435;120354;It 's Burns ' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown .;3
8433;6672;124243;When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . ';1
8434;977;21811;It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .;2
8435;4691;90108;I 've yet to find an actual Vietnam War combat movie actually produced by either the North or South Vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close .;3
8436;4249;82298;One of the best films I have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense .;3
8437;4351;84200;If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .;0
8438;4728;90855;Director Alfonso Cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of French New Wave films .;3
8439;779;17892;Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .;1
8440;7538;139059;One of the year 's best films , featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Julianne Moore .;4
8441;2140;44142;A return to pure Disney magic and is enjoyable family fare .;4
8442;5084;97254;The film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong .;3

8444;5932;111780;-LRB- A -RRB- stale retread of the '53 original .;1
8445;201;5121;A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .;1

8447;6509;121497;It 's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts Blue Crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies .;4
8448;3425;67468;Gloriously straight from the vagina .;2
8449;3987;77512;It does n't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one 's imagination will lead when given the opportunity .;1
8450;2050;42511;A strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of Wladyslaw Szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being .;4
8451;1685;35730;The movie is well done , but slow .;1
8452;4000;77797;This is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .;3
8453;4465;86229;Watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy .;4
8454;455;10723;Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements .;2
8455;5227;99634;Rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling Hollywood style -- casting excellent Latin actors of all ages -- a trend long overdue .;3
8456;2742;55044;The same should go for movie theaters .;2
8457;6092;114511;Despite the predictable parent vs. child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at `` the real Americans '' make this a charmer .;4
8458;3682;72101;There 's plenty to impress about E.T.;3
8459;2954;58620;A riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban Hades .;3
8460;8455;154637;And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .;1
8461;8436;154347;Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .;1
8462;319;7840;There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .;2
8463;4751;91322;One of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm .;4
8464;6755;125720;The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line .;1
8465;1520;32424;Time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness .;4
8466;2576;52159;I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .;1

8468;6389;119501;Best of all is Garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .;4
8469;6856;127459;The leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly .;4
8470;4097;79582;The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .;1
8471;6581;122652;But as you watch the movie , you 're too interested to care .;4
8472;5434;103081;A moving and not infrequently breathtaking film .;4
8473;706;16413;A real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .;4
8474;616;14287;This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .;1
8475;5490;104116;Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .;1
8476;2177;44873;This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .;0

8478;4871;93414;An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality .;1
8479;6252;117174;Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .;1
8480;3321;65557;The thing about guys like Evans is this : You 're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins .;1
8481;223;5597;Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .;0
8482;1409;30340;But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .;0
8483;7113;131945;Much of the digitally altered footage;2
8484;7774;143196;A delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it 's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow .;3
8485;6388;119468;What 's most memorable about Circuit is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables Shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb .;3
8486;1226;26726;Instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , Schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view .;3
8487;4720;90663;Confessions is n't always coherent , but it 's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong .;3
8488;6089;114458;Some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .;3

8491;8069;148266;The AAA of action , XXX is a blast of adrenalin , rated EEE for excitement .;4
8492;3698;72349;This 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than I 'd expected it to be .;3
8493;4053;78746;So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .;2
8494;154;4077;Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .;1
8495;1215;26490;Oh , look at that clever angle !;3
8496;3292;65069;It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual;3
8497;215;5367;Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .;2
8498;3566;70035;Ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer 's memory .;3
8499;2067;42815;Cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh .;4
8500;4789;92036;An impressive hybrid .;4
8501;5211;99369;Even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon .;3
8502;2839;56527;The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .;0
8503;971;21724;It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...;0

8507;4571;87988;Nor is it a romantic comedy .;2
8508;3138;62053;With few respites , Marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in Moulin Rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it .;4
8509;7342;135917;Be patient with the lovely Hush !;3
8510;5534;104806;Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .;0
8511;7395;136745;It 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling .;2
8512;7355;136110;It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .;3
8513;3127;61856;The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .;1
8514;273;6795;It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .;1

8516;5200;99149;I would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that should n't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable .;2
8517;4330;83752;The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .;1
8518;5776;109056;The ingenious construction -LRB- adapted by David Hare from Michael Cunningham 's novel -RRB- constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism;3
8519;7091;131595;Fred Schepisi 's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen .;0

8521;6612;123175;Majidi 's direction has never been smoother or more confident .;4
8522;4064;78981;As directed by Dani Kouyate of Burkina Faso , Sia lacks visual flair .;2
