3385;7047;130779;A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .;1
3386;479;11150;I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .;4
3387;4942;94703;A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .;1
3388;3152;62340;As comedic spotlights go , Notorious C.H.O. hits all the verbal marks it should .;3
3389;2695;54238;An action\/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of Day of the Jackal , The French Connection , and Heat .;4
3390;7970;146496;the film does n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half;1
3391;5376;102147;... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than -LRB- writer-director -RRB- Franc .;1
3392;2542;51576;The charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film 's problems .;3
3393;959;21431;The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed .;3
3394;5044;96550;contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II;1
3395;6888;128044;More good than great but Freeman and Judd make it work .;3
3396;4904;93974;Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .;3
3397;4180;81135;The level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with Washington the actor .;3
3398;2812;56137;You watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises .;3
3399;2874;57069;A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .;1
3400;2627;52994;From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .;1
3401;3947;76745;Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .;0
3402;13;353;The performances are an absolute joy .;4
3403;3712;72662;Everything about Girls Ca n't Swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .;1
3404;7621;140432;A winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s .;3
3405;1921;40102;Kinnear 's performance is a career-defining revelation .;4
3406;324;7953;A dreadful day in Irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment .;3
3407;6686;124454;Horrible .;0
3408;5260;100247;If the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material .;3
3409;5563;105349;Yep , it 's `` Waking up in Reno . '';2
3410;6051;113841;Chomp chomp !;2
3411;1020;22535;For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .;3
3412;4909;94080;Secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie .;4
3413;7725;142370;The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .;0
3414;6998;129973;The magic -LRB- and original running time -RRB- of ace Japanimator Hayao Miyazaki 's Spirited Away survives intact in BV 's re-voiced version .;3
3415;2848;56673;You 'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous -LRB- than Leon -RRB- .;1
3416;5775;109045;scenario that will give most parents pause ... Then , something terrible happens .;2
3417;3921;76331;Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .;2
3418;7285;134980;A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .;1
3419;1106;24321;Instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions .;3
3420;501;11610;Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .;4
3421;7172;132981;I loved the look of this film .;3
3422;8155;149780;Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .;2
3423;3353;66094;Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .;0
3424;5629;106579;The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .;0
3425;5546;104980;Instead of trying to bust some blondes , -LRB- Diggs -RRB- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .;1
3426;516;12005;So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride .;3
3427;1773;37374;This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time .;4
3428;3928;76455;Kosminsky ... puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting .;3
3429;2579;52215;Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .;1
3430;8217;150734;Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .;2
3431;2814;56159;Simply a re-hash of the other seven films .;1
3432;2842;56588;In The New Guy , even the bull gets recycled .;1
3433;4091;79422;The picture 's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .;3
3434;6292;117814;Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .;0
3435;1668;35433;Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .;1
3436;1358;29298;Spare yet audacious ...;2
3437;931;20859;Swimming is above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds .;4
3438;6130;115060;As action-adventure , this space-based homage to Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island fires on all plasma conduits .;3
3439;2339;47952;If you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time .;4
3440;3304;65276;Oh , and more entertaining , too .;3
3441;4008;77910;Too much power , not enough puff .;1
3442;4985;95429;True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .;0
3443;6402;119692;Director Jay Russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .;0
3444;3584;70320;You do n't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate Scratch , and that 's the mark of a documentary that works .;3
3445;3700;72383;Can I admit XXX is as deep as a Petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ?;1
3446;2315;47496;Pretty good little movie .;3
3447;5345;101581;What makes the movie special is its utter sincerity .;3
3448;48;1281;I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , I do n't see the point .;1
3449;3213;63505;Bravado Kathy !;3
3450;5054;96761;What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .;0
3451;667;15549;Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .;1
3452;4935;94529;What could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman 's tragic odyssey .;3
3453;2763;55369;This is a truly , truly bad movie .;1
3454;2616;52802;What 's next ?;3
3455;2637;53156;It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny .;4
3456;3542;69646;Patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .;1
3457;7573;139570;Leave it to John Sayles to take on developers , the Chamber of Commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie ... without neglecting character development for even one minute .;4
3458;6473;120932;Wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .;2
3459;540;12567;Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .;1
3460;1225;26708;... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .;1
3461;5500;104256;Grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect .;3
3462;4820;92541;The story itself is actually quite vapid .;1
3463;309;7624;Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .;3
3464;4257;82442;Presents a side of contemporary Chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation .;3
3465;89;2315;It shows us a slice of life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable .;3
3466;1702;36082;Yet the act is still charming here .;3
3467;6120;114913;Quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director Zhang 's last film , the cuddly Shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house .;2
3468;4183;81177;The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not .;1
3469;656;15295;Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .;1
3470;4231;82011;Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .;0
3471;5525;104631;It 's sort of in-between , and it works .;3
3472;2569;52052;Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .;1
3473;594;13773;A visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .;4
3474;8176;150090;You 'll forget about it by Monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids .;0
3475;2480;50434;But it 's also disappointing to a certain degree .;1
3476;4489;86644;Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .;1
3477;4684;90029;The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . '';1
3478;5586;105838;You could love Safe Conduct -LRB- Laissez Passer -RRB- for being a subtitled French movie that is 170 minutes long .;2
3479;8029;147547;It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .;3
3480;2608;52659;The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .;0
3481;2754;55237;Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .;1
3482;1904;39839;The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .;2
3483;6817;126798;A movie of riveting power and sadness .;4
3484;4349;84185;Like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls .;3
3485;6198;116277;One of the worst films of 2002 .;0
3486;3611;70836;A searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise .;3
3487;6752;125664;See it now , before the inevitable Hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles .;2
3488;7127;132184;For once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own .;3
3489;3073;60874;A refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market .;4
3490;4251;82339;Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf .;2
3491;2231;45870;... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .;0
3492;7977;146635;It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .;1
3493;4160;80745;A negligible British comedy .;1
3494;5845;110355;Like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it 's one tough rock .;3
3495;4314;83486;Significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition .;3
3496;8143;149610;Douglas McGrath 's Nicholas Nickleby does Dickens as it should be done cinematically .;4
3497;4901;93936;If only Merchant paid more attention the story .;1
3498;4586;88289;It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .;1
3499;492;11445;As saccharine as it is disposable .;1
3500;2539;51550;The fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .;1
3501;4348;84161;Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .;1
3502;6961;129467;`` Extreme Ops '' exceeds expectations .;3
3503;7820;144073;The film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality .;3
3504;3244;64112;The charm of Revolution OS is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers .;3
3505;2435;49661;The film has a childlike quality about it .;2
3506;4213;81663;The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .;0
3507;8011;147236;But , like Silence , it 's a movie that gets under your skin .;1
3508;7186;133209;-LRB- A -RRB- strong piece of work .;3

3510;2751;55162;A disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an Alice in Wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of TV 's Big Brother .;3
3511;1031;22765;An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .;2
3512;2039;42312;Frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the Kahlo movie Frida fans have been looking for .;2
3513;3862;75266;It has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect .;4
3514;2091;43283;while -LRB- Roman Coppola -RRB- scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story .;2
3515;880;19882;Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .;1
3516;5731;108293;A big fat pain .;1
3517;4316;83508;The big-screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison .;0
3518;8062;148142;... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !;0
3519;6780;126162;A compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day .;4
3520;1064;23443;With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .;1
3521;3551;69839;What 's left is a rich stew of longing .;2
3522;6025;113394;The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .;4
3523;7562;139443;Everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting .;3
3524;6133;115130;Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .;2
3525;6559;122361;Collapses under its own meager weight .;1
3526;956;21391;What 's invigorating about it is that it does n't give a damn .;3
3527;3275;64679;In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .;1
3528;8132;149408;Like The Full Monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .;4
3529;4313;83477;Smart , sassy interpretation of the Oscar Wilde play .;4
3530;2336;47899;Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .;0
3531;3526;69353;The film has a terrific look and Salma Hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life .;4
3532;697;16164;This movie is to be cherished .;4
3533;2796;55923;Sex is one of those films that aims to confuse .;1

3535;5262;100274;It is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .;3
3536;2;64;This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .;4
3537;1856;38914;Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .;0
3538;1926;40186;It 's not hateful .;2
3539;4627;89027;Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .;1

3776;2436;49668;There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .;1
3777;6899;128211;While not quite `` Shrek '' or `` Monsters , Inc. '' , it 's not too bad .;3
3778;3685;72146;The actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect .;2
3779;543;12626;What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .;3
3780;553;12860;The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .;3
3781;5388;102386;Feardotcom 's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work .;2
3782;1850;38785;A tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more .;3
3783;59;1569;Claude Chabrol 's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements .;3
3784;6247;117077;Although shot with little style , Skins is heartfelt and achingly real .;3
3785;7328;135648;There 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening .;1
3786;7728;142419;Frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him .;3
3787;3607;70755;As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .;0
3788;7394;136730;It would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde 's classic satire .;0
3789;4949;94859;The performances are remarkable .;4
3790;645;14990;... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .;4
3791;2338;47932;Beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart .;3
3792;5347;101598;A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .;1
3793;3753;73429;it 's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original .;4
3794;5508;104391;Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .;1
3795;2269;46623;In a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that Secret Ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .;3
3796;7437;137445;It 's tough to watch , but it 's a fantastic movie .;4
3797;3045;60295;It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .;1
3798;5762;108832;Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at Blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees .;1
3799;6075;114225;Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .;1
3800;7945;146111;One of the finest , most humane and important Holocaust movies ever made .;4
3801;7048;130785;Vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of Mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all .;4
3802;3063;60648;77 minutes of Pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does .;1
3803;6675;124291;The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .;0
3804;7919;145671;Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .;1
3805;7508;138601;Amazingly lame .;0
3806;400;9598;Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .;3
3807;2326;47734;A triumph of pure craft and passionate heart .;4
3808;1537;32801;Many of Benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice .;2
3809;6159;115566;Spy Kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : It actually improves upon the original hit movie .;4
3810;6371;119194;What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel .;1
3811;4368;84433;"It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story .";4
3812;8495;155176;Disgusting .;0
3813;391;9384;Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .;1
3814;2554;51770;One of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then .;4
3815;5208;99306;If you 're in the right B-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you .;3
3816;5650;107007;The entire cast is first-rate , especially Sorvino .;4
3817;5446;103274;A fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman .;3
3818;6655;123946;wo n't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , Daniel Auteuil , have a whale of a good time .;4
3819;4800;92231;Rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of Yiddish culture and language .;3
3820;7387;136633;Compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative Christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children .;3
3821;6662;124076;The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .;1
3822;5094;97399;Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` Unfaithful . '';0
3823;1866;39087;The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .;0
3824;1292;28124;The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .;0
3825;777;17874;A gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema;3
3826;2765;55389;The fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that Broomfield 's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer .;3
3827;6588;122815;An average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son 's discovery of his homosexuality .;2
3828;5572;105517;A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .;0
3829;4575;88071;It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .;1
3830;5647;106937;meanders between its powerful moments .;2
3831;6627;123437;Drug abuse , infidelity and death are n't usually comedy fare , but Turpin 's film allows us to chuckle through the angst .;3
3832;4332;83796;Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .;1
3833;4355;84266;"A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .";1
3834;7130;132249;Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .;3
3835;1043;23022;-LRB- I -RRB- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .;1
3836;2388;48895;As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .;0
3837;5479;103887;A drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy .;2
3838;8274;151662;Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .;0
3839;3983;77430;... quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks .;3
3840;4394;84985;Scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf .;3
3841;2518;51158;Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .;2
3842;6328;118434;That rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .;3
3843;6236;116871;Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .;0
3844;1470;31418;If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .;0
3845;4434;85710;Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .;1
3846;2443;49816;A grating , emaciated flick .;1
3847;8490;155118;An engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement .;3
3848;2900;57475;Sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to Frida Kahlo as if her life did , too .;2
3849;5295;100795;Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .;1
3850;1097;24126;The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .;3
3851;8320;152460;Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .;1
3852;5155;98349;While obviously aimed at kids , The Country Bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio .;3
3853;4697;90238;Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .;1
3854;8500;155278;Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .;0
3855;2006;41684;Empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .;1
3856;2070;42845;I 've never bought from telemarketers , but I bought this movie .;3
3857;1925;40169;It 's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you 've seen the remake first .;2
3858;3799;74170;Grating and tedious .;1
3859;2101;43455;But even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between Jolie and Burns ... this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to Screenwriting For Dummies conformity .;2
3860;5728;108261;Bacon keeps things interesting , but do n't go out of your way to pay full price .;2
3861;2468;50214;Sometimes shorter is better .;2
3862;4198;81421;Dog Soldiers does n't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it .;3
3863;2536;51504;A no-holds-barred cinematic treat .;4
3864;6623;123357;It 's worth taking the kids to .;4
3865;2463;50140;Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .;0
3866;6570;122488;That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .;1
3867;4011;77941;The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .;2
3868;3660;71721;Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .;3
3869;6539;121968;It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .;2
3870;4303;83329;No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas .;1
3871;2935;58240;` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . ';1
3872;2096;43358;A static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .;2
3873;282;7037;First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .;1
3874;5214;99439;There is nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a - thousand-times - before movie .;0
3875;7526;138871;Generic thriller junk .;0
3876;3498;68857;`` Freaky Friday , '' it 's not .;1

3880;2977;59001;Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .;1

3882;3182;62890;Thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic .;1
3883;3334;65755;The movie 's captivating details are all in the performances , from Foreman 's barking-mad Taylor to Thewlis 's smoothly sinister Freddie and Bettany\/McDowell 's hard-eyed gangster .;4
3884;6721;125054;This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .;1
3885;3260;64392;Brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .;2
3886;770;17754;A generic international version of a typical American horror film .;1
3887;6083;114386;You do n't want to call the cops .;2
3888;1116;24516;LaBute masterfully balances both Traditional or Modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other .;4

3890;3381;66616;Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .;0
3891;2895;57424;Warm and exotic .;3

3893;8106;148978;The art demands live viewing .;3
3894;5524;104599;It comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if BA , Murdock and rest of the A-Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .;2
3895;8287;151869;In its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , Time Out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything I have seen in an American film .;3
3896;8239;151134;Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .;0
3897;8331;152661;Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?;1
3898;1583;33708;It trusts the story it sets out to tell .;4
3899;5943;111962;This is n't exactly profound cinema , but it 's good-natured and sometimes quite funny .;3
3900;1276;27776;All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .;1
3901;5394;102487;At its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating .;3
3902;7090;131565;A few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are n't likely to enter the theater .;3
3903;1479;31575;Stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .;3
3904;624;14469;Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .;3
3905;403;9651;Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -;3
3906;5757;108761;It 's not too fast and not too slow .;3
3907;3393;66875;Contradicts everything we 've come to expect from movies nowadays .;3
3908;1057;23317;It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .;3
3909;5003;95771;It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .;4
3910;1413;30443;The production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating .;4
3911;604;14036;A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences .;0
3912;4640;89270;Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .;1
3913;4088;79351;Russian Ark is a new treasure of the Hermitage .;3
3914;4499;86842;Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .;1
3915;5646;106921;The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .;1
3916;1559;33275;A sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire .;4
3917;3273;64653;One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .;1
3918;8505;155394;It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .;3
3919;666;15530;A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .;1
3920;1128;24752;One of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made .;4
3921;4859;93203;But there 's plenty to offend everyone ...;1
3922;5621;106422;Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .;1
3923;4717;90617;Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .;0
3924;3580;70297;Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .;2
3925;3549;69777;By the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better .;2
3926;7375;136400;Still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences .;4
3927;4261;82525;Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .;0
3928;4268;82655;... while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n't really go anywhere .;1
3929;46;1225;Less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling -LRB- though no less horrifying for it -RRB- .;3
3930;3299;65186;His work with actors is particularly impressive .;4
3931;2321;47606;Gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , -LRB- Harris -RRB- brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging Sandeman .;3
3932;1836;38508;It was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .;2
3933;5053;96748;Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone .;2

3938;3896;75945;More trifle than triumph .;1
3939;2938;58279;Playing a role of almost Bergmanesque intensity ... Bisset is both convincing and radiant .;3

3942;4004;77862;Delight your senses and crash this wedding !;4
3943;7953;146269;Just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .;3
3944;2074;42930;Stuffed to the brim with ideas , American instigator Michael Moore 's film is a rambling examination of American gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition .;3
3945;2279;46805;From both a great and a terrible story , Mr. Nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience .;3

3955;7213;133702;The Lady and the Duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the French Revolution from the aristocrats ' perspective .;3
3956;4098;79607;Disjointed parody .;1
3957;44;1199;This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .;1

3959;404;9708;Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .;1

4156;1088;23954;Charlie Hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a Dickensian hero .;4
4157;388;9301;Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .;4
4158;6453;120662;And , there 's no way you wo n't be talking about the film once you exit the theater .;3
4159;7637;140765;It 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .;4
4160;4833;92788;A timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices .;3
4161;780;17918;feeling to it , but like the 1920 's , the trip there is a great deal of fun .;3
4162;6474;120943;No , I hate it .;0
4163;7616;140327;The tonal shifts are jolting , and though Wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .;2

4165;7012;130218;I have a new favorite musical -- and I 'm not even a fan of the genre;3
4166;5502;104284;There are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .;2
4167;8329;152622;It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .;1
4168;4624;88979;I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .;1
4169;1907;39906;an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? '';2
4170;1314;28408;Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .;2
4171;1134;24860;Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .;1
4172;5219;99530;Overall , Cletis Tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone .;4
4173;1803;37899;` Tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of The Next Pretty Good Thing .;2
4174;3197;63211;An incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks .;3
4175;6797;126431;An excellent sequel .;4
4176;6694;124579;So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie .;2
4177;468;10970;Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .;1
4178;8289;151906;... if you 're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch Freaks as a matinee .;2

4183;1260;27452;... a light , yet engrossing piece .;3
4184;7007;130088;Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .;1
4185;5012;95928;A movie that 's held captive by mediocrity .;1

4195;7101;131713;By the final whistle you 're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just does n't have big screen magic .;1
4196;8351;152973;An intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives .;3

4198;8149;149698;At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .;1
4199;5463;103575;I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .;3
4200;2294;47038;An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .;1
4201;4990;95564;To others , it will remind them that Hong Kong action cinema is still alive and kicking .;3
4202;783;17950;Disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical `` Bedknobs and Broomsticks , '' which also dealt with British children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime .;2
4203;4118;79933;Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .;0
4204;1033;22835;Eh .;2
4205;234;5857;Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .;0
4206;6373;119228;A good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera .;3
4207;5182;98800;Like Showgirls and Glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .;1
4208;7323;135569;It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .;0
4209;7161;132805;For all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between Sullivan and his son .;4
4210;2766;55416;Despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , Empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining .;3
4211;2721;54665;Snow Dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him;1
4212;6791;126329;The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .;1
4213;5800;109496;A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .;0
4214;230;5796;Or both .;2
4215;5986;112720;A funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a British cast to rival Gosford Park 's .;4
4216;2728;54776;Zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that 's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does .;3
4217;1887;39515;The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .;1
4218;4080;79218;Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King .;1
4219;3871;75501;A heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist .;4
4220;8079;148472;The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .;1
4221;2344;48060;Its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work .;3
4222;240;5982;A chronicle not only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department .;3
4223;7679;141544;Suffers from a flat script and a low budget .;1
4224;3571;70121;I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .;1

4228;6807;126602;Weird , vulgar comedy that 's definitely an acquired taste .;2
4229;1540;32882;An ugly , revolting movie .;1
4230;8425;154173;If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .;3
4231;6027;113422;... salaciously simplistic .;2
4232;5830;110090;`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .;0
4233;4604;88603;little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .;1
4234;8004;147059;LaBute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .;4
4235;7199;133407;We do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close .;1
4236;4522;87176;Savvy director Robert J. Siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense .;3
4237;5763;108859;Often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it 's very much like life itself .;3
4238;2671;53795;A quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness .;3
4239;8439;154394;Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .;2
4240;1379;29759;There is nothing redeeming about this movie .;0

4242;7942;146035;With Dirty Deeds , David Caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen .;4
4243;1638;34808;A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .;0
4244;7740;142558;As we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- Jason is a killer who does n't know the meaning of the word ` quit . ';2
4245;2295;47048;Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?;0
4246;6036;113526;At its best , which occurs often , Michael Moore 's Bowling for Columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the ` Are we a sick society ? ';3
4247;4187;81230;Moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought .;4
4248;4245;82243;Translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be Ya-Ya .;3
4249;7837;144347;Weaver and LaPaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .;4
4250;4954;94952;Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .;1

4255;5518;104540;Crummy .;0
4256;8097;148827;A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .;1
4257;2787;55709;What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .;0
4258;1815;38170;I 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper .;1
4259;4568;87953;The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .;1
4260;476;11109;More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .;1
4261;6283;117689;The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .;0
