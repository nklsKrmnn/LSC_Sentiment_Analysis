2431;2004;41638;Director David Jacobson gives Dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims .;2
2432;5178;98729;Slow and ponderous , but Rohmer 's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and Christian love in the face of political corruption .;3

2440;1945;40621;As Antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion .;3

2447;4028;78277;Directors John Musker and Ron Clements , the team behind The Little Mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they are n't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .;2

2461;6496;121293;I 've never seen -LRB- a remake -RRB- do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates Frank Capra 's classic ...;0
2462;8362;153128;While most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that 's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world .;3
2463;4569;87968;It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .;1
2464;2502;50860;Is truth stranger than fiction ?;2
2465;1359;29301;With three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it 's enough to make you wish Jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .;2
2466;4837;92855;It is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise .;3

2483;638;14829;Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .;1

2492;1274;27742;A college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing !;3
2493;7364;136210;This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your ABC 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .;0
2494;6813;126711;The story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director Shekhar Kapur supplies with tremendous skill .;4

2528;3783;73974;... bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film .;4
2529;7381;136508;Entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn .;3
2530;5515;104501;The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .;0
2531;3540;69616;The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .;1

2533;4810;92365;Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .;1
2534;2409;49249;The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .;1
2535;6993;129882;Neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest Attal and Gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .;3
2536;5288;100681;It 's a rare window on an artistic collaboration .;3
2537;7902;145447;The pitch must have read like a discarded House Beautiful spread .;2
2538;289;7123;Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .;4

2544;3287;64928;Colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , Burkinabe filmmaker Dani Kouyate 's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .;2
2545;1339;28881;The Trinity Assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and George Ratliff 's documentary , Hell House , reflects their earnestness -- which makes for a terrifying film .;2
2546;2487;50559;This Chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare .;4
2547;4130;80164;An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .;0
2548;2781;55641;What 's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm .;3
2549;5217;99480;Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .;1
2550;2169;44721;With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .;0
2551;4793;92079;It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .;2

2553;3881;75707;Stuart 's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of Snowball 's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating .;2

2556;5207;99291;It is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival .;2
2557;4891;93766;Noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism .;2
2558;3538;69586;Nevertheless , it still seems endless .;1
2559;887;19998;A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .;2

2569;7828;144213;Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice .;2
2570;4829;92692;It 's clear that Mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of Indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent .;2
2571;1289;28050;As home movie gone haywire , it 's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , I 'd rather listen to old Tori Amos records .;2
2572;8003;147041;Circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets .;2
2573;8268;151576;The film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots .;3
2574;8298;152086;It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .;1
2575;8357;153051;... a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department .;4
2576;3714;72696;Examines its explosive subject matter as nonjudgmentally as Wiseman 's previous studies of inner-city high schools , hospitals , courts and welfare centers .;2

2579;922;20653;So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .;0
2580;7690;141738;Tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of Yasujiro Ozu .;2
2581;3380;66600;And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .;0
2582;4341;84016;A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .;0
2583;6895;128148;Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .;0
2584;6383;119371;And for all the wrong reasons besides .;1
2585;3088;61117;Foster and Whitaker are especially fine .;4
2586;4783;91909;Never does `` Lilo & Stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of Disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` Mulan '' or `` Tarzan . '';1
2587;6891;128089;A movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts .;1
2588;4500;86855;It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .;3
2589;1906;39887;The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .;1
2590;367;8798;Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .;3
2591;6958;129398;What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .;0
2592;3472;68413;Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .;1

2594;2679;53949;Miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection .;3
2595;3624;71065;Brave and sweetly rendered love story .;3
2596;550;12761;A small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .;3
2597;3083;61016;On that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint .;4
2598;8510;155472;It never rises to its clever what-if concept .;1
2599;5520;104551;Cold , nervy and memorable .;3
2600;81;2102;All in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own .;3
2601;7094;131635;The film is full of charm .;3
2602;482;11192;Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .;2

2604;3689;72205;displays the potential for a better movie than what Bailly manages to deliver;2
2605;2390;48954;This film is so different from The Apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see Samira Makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .;3
2606;2310;47374;Murderous Maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the Papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy ...;3
2607;1891;39615;The audacity to view one of Shakespeare 's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion .;1

2613;7932;145903;Succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture .;3
2614;5837;110207;Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .;0
2615;791;18126;The movie is a trove of delights .;4
2616;5072;97036;A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .;1
2617;1521;32440;In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .;1
2618;6105;114721;He 's the scariest guy you 'll see all summer .;3
2619;4764;91540;Believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half .;2
2620;4230;81989;A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .;1
2621;2835;56467;The story is predictable , the jokes are typical Sandler fare , and the romance with Ryder is puzzling .;1
2622;7350;136049;Often overwrought and at times positively irritating , the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself .;2
2623;5349;101626;With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .;1
2624;2619;52841;Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .;3
2625;5874;110850;Cox creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of Nijinsky 's diaries .;3

2644;25;687;The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .;2
2645;6259;117303;Not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece .;4
2646;1223;26654;The Santa Clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry .;1

2648;2391;48995;Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .;1
2649;3404;67054;Nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book .;3
2650;6533;121894;The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .;1
2651;6724;125105;The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable .;1
2652;488;11333;There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .;1

2945;928;20790;Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .;1

2992;6631;123483;It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .;0
2993;8445;154472;What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .;0
2994;1234;26877;And it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .;3

3004;4176;81035;A portrait of hell so shattering it 's impossible to shake .;3

3012;8247;151276;A sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters .;3
3013;335;8114;The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .;3

3017;536;12491;Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .;1
3018;1637;34790;An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship .;4
3019;3464;68229;Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .;1
3020;3076;60906;Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .;0

3040;3408;67137;-LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .;1

3043;3323;65580;a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre;0

3048;8407;153888;Terminally brain dead production .;0
3049;3247;64170;A surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy .;3
3050;3946;76720;As Schmidt , Nicholson walks with a slow , deliberate gait , chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance .;2
3051;960;21458;Punitively affirmational parable .;2
3052;878;19861;The result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking .;4
3053;5626;106543;It 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .;4
3054;636;14777;This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential;3
3055;4765;91558;With We Were Soldiers , Hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the Vietnam War before the pathology set in .;3
3056;598;13892;I ca n't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail .;2
3057;4436;85751;The action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the Star Wars series .;3
3058;3771;73744;I liked this film a lot ...;3
3059;4652;89477;There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .;1

3061;5808;109623;A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .;3

3068;7711;142136;Beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , One Hour Photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures .;3

3122;3999;77767;Call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but I believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .;0
3123;6713;124910;It 's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas ' classic .;2
3124;1385;29880;If you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then Triple X marks the spot .;3
3125;2531;51379;He has a great cast and a great idea .;4
3126;4068;79039;If you 're a Crocodile Hunter fan , you 'll enjoy at least the `` real '' portions of the film .;2
3127;4308;83396;Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !;1
3128;2146;44244;It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .;1
3129;7324;135588;`` Looking For Leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .;1
3130;8128;149372;Best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events .;3
3131;7219;133785;A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .;1
3132;2446;49860;What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .;0
3133;7517;138717;Will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year .;4
3134;4956;94981;Yet another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ...;1
3135;2762;55353;It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .;2
3136;1825;38331;Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .;1
3137;750;17274;What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .;2
3138;5464;103589;The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .;2
3139;8162;149895;What makes it worth watching is Quaid 's performance .;3
3140;4353;84223;In trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .;2
3141;1605;34154;` Snow Dogs ' has both .;2
3142;1588;33763;... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .;0
3143;2287;46939;... delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story .;2
3144;6644;123728;For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie .;3
3145;3000;59480;But the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .;4
3146;7290;135031;Perhaps not since Nelson Eddy crooned his Indian Love Call to Jeanette MacDonald has there been a movie so unabashedly Canadian , not afraid to risk American scorn or disinterest .;2
3147;4144;80433;Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .;2
3148;5409;102677;- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .;0
3149;2423;49501;Terrific performances , great to look at , and funny .;4
3150;7445;137611;An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .;0
3151;5565;105372;The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .;1
3152;1565;33382;A lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe .;3
3153;905;20294;Been there done that .;1
3154;3622;71024;Her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks .;3
3155;2337;47925;A three-hour cinema master class .;3
3156;137;3643;Intriguing and downright intoxicating .;4
3157;3255;64287;For those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their \*\*\* off for an hour-and-a-half .;4
3158;6812;126691;Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .;0
3159;4327;83709;Goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse .;2
3160;1474;31488;Broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force .;2
3161;4682;89969;Works because we 're never sure if Ohlinger 's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks .;2
3162;2674;53865;A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .;0
3163;2581;52244;The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .;0
3164;6330;118476;are both superb , while Huppert ... is magnificent .;4
3165;6894;128125;The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .;2
3166;8347;152911;A rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .;4
3167;6190;116154;A feature-length , R-rated , road-trip version of Mama 's Family .;2
3168;7736;142513;Kids who are into this Thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven .;3
3169;8372;153287;Between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism .;3
3170;1963;40942;A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .;1
3171;1903;39815;More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .;1
3172;596;13836;It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift .;2
3173;7029;130450;What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !;0
3174;859;19555;An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .;1
3175;3631;71148;... digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations .;3
3176;7734;142480;A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .;1
3177;6992;129855;It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling .;1
3178;2593;52411;With a cast of A-list Brit actors , it is worth searching out .;4
3179;8022;147431;There is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all .;3
3180;5815;109753;In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -LRB- but none of the sheer lust -RRB- .;1
3181;2189;45074;Cho 's timing is priceless .;4
3182;2745;55072;Pull -LRB- s -RRB- off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel .;2
3183;5246;99969;A terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown .;3
3184;1229;26772;This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel , Seth Green and Barry Pepper .;2
3185;5420;102832;This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .;0
3186;3729;73012;Always destined to be measured against Anthony Asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .;3
3187;7;199;Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .;1
3188;2208;45431;The Four Feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes .;3
3189;6978;129713;God is great , the movie 's not .;2
3190;1782;37510;... they missed the boat .;2
3191;6896;128160;A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .;1
3192;5694;107742;Writer\/director David Caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza .;4
3193;8186;150303;Like a can of 2-day old Coke .;0
3194;4373;84516;It 's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after .;1
3195;37;1003;It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .;1
3196;5720;108114;No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .;2
3197;1502;32079;Qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere .;2
3198;5558;105257;While not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging .;2
