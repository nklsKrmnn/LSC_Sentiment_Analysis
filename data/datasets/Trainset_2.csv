1264;6839;127172;The Movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance .;3
1265;6628;123459;Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .;0
1266;6938;129000;Both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics .;3
1267;3900;75982;With one exception , every blighter in this particular South London housing project digs into dysfunction like it 's a big , comforting jar of Marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness .;2
1268;3360;66277;No thanks .;1
1269;5940;111901;Tsai Ming-liang 's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being .;2
1270;7238;134120;Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .;1
1271;3694;72266;It 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom .;3
1272;4997;95654;Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .;3
1273;5263;100302;Until -LRB- the -RRB- superfluous ... epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , Die Another Day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any James Bond thriller .;2
1274;602;13972;A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .;2
1275;280;6981;In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .;0
1276;3429;67532;"It has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out .";3
1277;4057;78833;Maybe Thomas Wolfe was right : You ca n't go home again .;2
1278;613;14210;You walk out of The Good Girl with mixed emotions -- disapproval of Justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions .;3
1279;2591;52384;Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .;0
1280;1748;36883;A muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any Scorsese has ever given us .;3
1281;4688;90068;Despite its raucous intent , XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad and as rebellious as spring break .;2
1282;6723;125100;Beautifully directed and convincingly acted .;3
1283;1277;27804;A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .;0
1284;1317;28468;The film truly does rescue -LRB- the Funk Brothers -RRB- from Motown 's shadows .;2
1285;6242;117005;an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind;3
1286;2170;44749;Life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .;2
1287;7344;135968;Beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .;4
1288;775;17846;Brady;3
1289;6580;122649;One funny popcorn flick .;3
1290;2985;59156;I prefer Soderbergh 's concentration on his two lovers over Tarkovsky 's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies .;2
1291;1115;24514;Truly terrible .;0
1292;5310;101066;What it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .;2
1293;6013;113200;It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .;0
1294;1783;37516;Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .;0
1295;7339;135885;Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .;1
1296;7874;144978;The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .;1
1297;5225;99595;May lack the pungent bite of its title , but it 's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless .;3
1298;5450;103365;Narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself .;2
1299;3936;76547;A preposterous , prurient whodunit .;0
1300;1132;24812;Light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .;4
1301;4514;87057;To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .;0
1302;8328;152601;The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .;4
1303;3388;66767;While the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work .;3
1304;1982;41301;The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .;2
1305;6640;123640;Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .;1
1306;3445;67855;Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying .;2
1307;2922;57990;No surprises .;1
1308;7289;135026;Who is the audience for Cletis Tout ?;2
1309;756;17417;While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .;3
1310;8039;147746;The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .;1
1311;5121;97801;Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .;1
1312;2693;54215;The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .;2
1313;7589;139861;More timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by Iran to the Afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food .;4
1314;5981;112638;The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .;0
1315;3773;73769;Largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .;2
1316;8204;150549;It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity .;3
1317;8024;147457;The kind of primal storytelling that George Lucas can only dream of .;3
1318;5611;106270;... a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations .;3
1319;2783;55662;Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .;0
1320;904;20284;Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .;0
1321;3873;75521;This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .;2
1322;8498;155246;The culmination of everyone 's efforts is given life when A Selection appears in its final form -LRB- in `` Last Dance '' -RRB- .;2
1323;2302;47237;a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002 's first great film;4
1324;6148;115376;One of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the French film industry in years .;4
1325;389;9326;The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Everyman is in the details .;3
1326;8293;151963;These three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people .;4
1327;275;6847;Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .;1
1328;6384;119378;Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .;3
1329;6363;119039;The riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make Love a joy to behold .;4
1330;6070;114151;Paul Bettany is cool .;3
1331;8146;149643;That the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that Chin 's film serves up with style and empathy .;3
1332;5083;97223;Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject .;1
1333;8077;148425;Thirteen Conversations About One Thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a Mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .;3
1334;5378;102177;If you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy .;3
1335;6458;120721;It 's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens ' grandeur .;4
1336;7527;138874;The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .;0
1337;256;6449;A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .;3
1338;5441;103152;What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .;1
1339;5891;111139;... a guiltless film for nice evening out .;3
1340;6289;117776;Puts to rest any thought that the German film industry can not make a delightful comedy centering on food .;4
1341;5365;101914;Argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she 's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock .;3
1342;8090;148704;Heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple 's moral ascension .;2
1343;8266;151541;Takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights .;4
1344;3547;69749;Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .;0
1345;1099;24178;The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .;0
1346;1696;35934;Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .;0
1347;1148;25096;` Matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy .;1
1348;2041;42352;Neither the funniest film that Eddie Murphy nor Robert De Niro has ever made , Showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while .;3
1349;6223;116693;Despite its faults , Gangs excels in spectacle and pacing .;3
1350;8379;153406;this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it 's a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .;2
1351;1070;23589;waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it .;3
1352;3556;69913;Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter .;2
1353;7368;136288;A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .;2
1354;283;7053;I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .;2
1355;4776;91763;Taken as a whole , The Tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .;1
1356;5693;107717;This rich , bittersweet Israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man Pasach ` ke Burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .;3
1357;329;8028;A relative letdown .;0
1358;3121;61748;A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .;1
1359;1801;37864;Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .;1
1360;7408;136946;It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- The Believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .;3
1361;551;12784;Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .;2
1362;5372;102051;A quasi-documentary by French filmmaker Karim Dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of Cuban music .;3
1363;7045;130760;The best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments .;2
1364;3977;77320;Not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by The Piano Teacher .;2
1365;1320;28564;A playful Iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences .;3
1366;6505;121414;A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder;1
1367;4710;90482;Though Frodo 's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined New Zealanders has proved its creative mettle .;2
1368;1659;35294;But it 's worth the concentration .;3
1369;6731;125257;Jae-eun Jeong 's Take Care of My Cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the South Korean cinema .;3
1370;2634;53082;This bracingly truthful antidote to Hollywood teenage movies that slather Clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty .;3
1371;8528;155803;It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .;3
1372;5395;102500;Simone is not a bad film .;3
1373;2709;54507;You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .;0
1374;8255;151394;Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .;2
1375;1315;28425;National Lampoon 's Van Wilder may aim to be the next Animal House , but it more closely resembles this year 's version of Tomcats .;2
1376;8230;150974;Forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?;1
1377;3557;69923;This thing is just garbage .;0
1378;2572;52087;The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?;1
1379;6897;128184;Offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory .;4
1380;8363;153151;She boxes these women 's souls right open for us .;3
1381;5545;104969;Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .;2
1382;3675;71950;I love the robust middle of this picture .;4
1383;188;4872;Uneven but a lot of fun .;3
1384;6382;119358;... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .;0
1385;1071;23609;Disturbing .;1
1386;5526;104640;Impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act .;2
1387;302;7422;Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .;3
1388;6535;121935;The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .;1
1389;635;14726;There has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but Peter Mattei 's Love in the Time of Money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive -LRB- if tragic -RRB- note .;3
1390;2563;51938;The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .;1
1391;1194;26066;Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .;1
1392;1447;31041;`` Red Dragon '' is entertaining .;4
1393;1405;30273;It 's just not very smart .;1
1394;8369;153245;And it 's a lousy one at that .;0
1395;3708;72578;Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .;1
1396;49;1305;Jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers .;4
1397;6816;126773;It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .;1
1398;6939;129016;It 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor .;3
1399;6244;117033;So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .;2
1400;1343;28979;I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .;2
1401;5322;101233;It 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental .;2
1402;3932;76500;This is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life .;4
1403;2555;51797;Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on `` The Mothman Prophecies '' .;2
1404;7419;137173;This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .;1
1405;6222;116686;Just watch Bettany strut his stuff .;2
1406;2211;45473;Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .;0
1407;2054;42580;The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and Kurys ' direction is clever and insightful .;4
1408;4480;86502;While Glover , the irrepressible eccentric of River 's Edge , Dead Man and Back to the Future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents Bartleby 's main overall flaw .;2
1409;833;18962;More than anything else , Kissing Jessica Stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake Sleepless in Seattle again and again .;4
1410;1896;39701;Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .;1
1411;2964;58778;The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels;4
1412;1710;36192;Often hilarious .;3
1413;2904;57560;"However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .";2
1414;755;17384;Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works , Invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .;4
1415;1311;28373;I will be .;3
1416;4156;80681;An unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture .;3
1417;5519;104541;Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality;2
1418;1467;31369;It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .;0
1419;5786;109271;The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .;0
1420;4396;85014;A solidly entertaining little film .;3
1421;2157;44502;... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts .;2
1422;2148;44287;The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .;3
1423;7241;134155;So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .;1
1424;3723;72905;Possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure .;2
1425;5928;111688;What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .;0
1426;6019;113290;A well-acted movie that simply does n't gel .;2
1427;3767;73657;There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .;1
1428;721;16687;It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists .;2
1429;3553;69873;More a gunfest than a Rock concert .;1
1430;3214;63509;About Schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year .;4
1431;1138;24973;Good-naturedly cornball sequel .;3
1432;7299;135200;There are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but Brown Sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy .;2
1433;4109;79773;It gets old quickly .;1
1434;4061;78919;It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .;2
1435;4092;79443;It 's Jagger 's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite .;2
1436;6097;114593;It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .;2
1437;5914;111481;... quite endearing .;3
1438;7227;133932;A Movie to Forget;1
1439;2415;49357;A movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment . ';3
1440;2376;48651;Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .;1
1441;4862;93240;Not quite as miraculous as its DreamWorks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions .;3
1442;4386;84792;A hard look at one man 's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of Claude Chabrol .;3
1443;3231;63844;A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .;3
1444;3585;70340;Gets the look and the period trappings right;3
1445;4834;92805;It 's stylishly directed with verve ...;3
1446;2111;43604;The film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority .;3
1447;5303;100963;Murder by Numbers just does n't add up .;1
1448;3891;75850;By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .;3
1449;4767;91624;Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .;0
1450;5711;107957;A fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man .;3
1451;4648;89393;One of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them .;4
1452;2933;58198;Moretti ... is the rare common-man artist who 's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness .;3
1453;3576;70222;I ca n't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ...;0
1454;8103;148945;Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .;0
1455;3040;60230;A very capable nailbiter .;3
1456;1939;40514;... there 's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages .;3
1457;7990;146853;A mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in .;4
1458;5177;98701;It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .;0
1459;3146;62226;We have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting .;2
1460;7954;146283;Unofficially , National Lampoon 's Van Wilder is Son of Animal House .;2
1461;7416;137102;One thing 's for sure -- if George Romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .;1
1462;2725;54728;But tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of For the most part Wilde 's droll whimsy helps `` Being Earnest '' overcome its weaknesses and Parker 's creative interference ...;3

1464;7263;134602;Their computer-animated faces are very expressive .;3
1465;6444;120514;By turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic .;3
1466;8544;156040;The film is darkly atmospheric , with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst 's forced avuncular chortles .;2
1467;4090;79396;The film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work .;4
1468;2834;56453;Like a veteran head cutter , Barbershop is tuned in to its community .;3
1469;3329;65676;All comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad .;0
1470;4211;81621;A beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder .;4
1471;1019;22519;The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .;1
1472;1166;25478;At its best when the guarded , resentful Betty and the manipulative yet needy Margot are front and center .;2
1473;3539;69592;This is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice .;4
1474;512;11944;With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .;2
1475;7817;144017;The heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in -LRB- this -RRB- meandering and pointless French coming-of-age import from writer-director Anne-Sophie Birot .;0

1477;6128;115033;Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .;3
1478;5052;96724;It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .;0
1479;1934;40445;In -LRB- screenwriter -RRB- Charlie Kaufman 's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking .;2
1480;1698;35967;Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .;4
1481;4702;90332;This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? ';0
1482;1908;39918;... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .;0
1483;6771;126025;A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .;4
1484;7615;140311;For all the wit and hoopla , Festival In Cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships .;3
1485;7951;146210;"Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .";0
1486;1356;29271;Does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character 's story .;3
1487;5170;98628;Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .;2
1488;7421;137208;A mess , but it 's a sincere mess .;2
1489;7308;135310;That rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults .;4

1493;2493;50681;Like Edward Norton in American History X , Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder By Numbers -RRB- delivers a magnetic performance .;4
1494;5550;105053;The enjoyable Undercover Brother , a zany mix of Saturday Night Live-style parody , '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .;4
1495;5086;97280;... certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes .;3
1496;705;16376;Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . '';3
1497;5421;102863;A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .;2
1498;249;6254;It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .;3
1499;6646;123778;It 's like Rocky and Bullwinkle on Speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness .;1
1500;4234;82072;Meandering and confusing .;1
1501;4296;83194;A whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking Christian-themed fun .;4
1502;717;16625;Poetry in motion captured on film .;4
1503;3467;68310;Like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .;2
1504;4815;92452;Simplistic , silly and tedious .;1
1505;4635;89179;The bodily function jokes are about what you 'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie .;3
1506;6256;117252;This thing works on no level whatsoever for me .;0
1507;5570;105479;Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .;1
1508;7228;133933;Irwin is so earnest that it 's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs .;4
1509;5283;100637;Sweetly sexy , funny and touching .;4
1510;7025;130401;A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .;2
1511;1675;35564;This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .;1
1512;6368;119134;Adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel .;4
1513;6074;114216;The screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as Hip-Hop Scooby-Doo .;2
1514;6067;114139;It has plenty of laughs .;3
1515;24;648;That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .;2
1516;7424;137229;The film 's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling .;2
1517;2053;42561;The low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love .;3
1518;203;5144;Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .;2
1519;2412;49292;Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...;1
1520;5;157;Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .;1
1521;290;7141;A slight but sweet film .;3
1522;2898;57453;The off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery .;3
1523;1646;34982;Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved;0
1524;7205;133535;The cameo-packed , M : I-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything .;2
1525;6144;115333;Gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .;2
1526;2441;49758;If `` Lilo & Stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of Disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` Dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years .;4
1527;3496;68829;Captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head .;4
1528;2466;50166;Scooby-Doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , Nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .;1
1529;6854;127428;A movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events .;1
1530;7136;132340;A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .;0
1531;2274;46723;Delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity .;3
1532;872;19767;Unlike most surf movies , Blue Crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave .;3
1533;2881;57197;Directed without the expected flair or imagination by Hong Kong master John Woo , Windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .;1
1534;2227;45804;It 's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .;3
1535;8427;154227;More mature than Fatal Attraction , more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 Weeks , Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .;4
1536;4855;93159;his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .;1
1537;2255;46367;As a director , Paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip .;4
1538;7949;146167;Japanese director Shohei Imamura 's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime .;3
1539;2836;56484;Tends to plod .;1
1540;6350;118802;Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .;1
1541;4494;86750;A film of ideas and wry comic mayhem .;3
1542;185;4828;At a brief 42 minutes , we need more X and less blab .;2
1543;2176;44846;Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .;1
1544;7620;140405;The acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans .;3
1545;3925;76392;A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .;0
1546;7512;138651;An awfully good , achingly human picture .;3
1547;7000;130000;Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .;1
1548;58;1539;Mark Pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .;3
1549;4179;81099;Plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision .;3
1550;4272;82714;It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .;2
1551;3986;77494;When the movie mixes the cornpone and the Cosa Nostra , it finds a nice rhythm .;3
1552;8408;153892;An interesting look behind the scenes of Chicago-based rock group Wilco ...;3
1553;4164;80817;A passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action .;4
1554;8027;147484;In questioning the election process , Payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the Iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box .;3
1555;4173;80967;Everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .;1
1556;3493;68739;It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but Olympia , Wash. , based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting .;3
1557;6208;116415;-LRB- A -RRB- smarter and much funnier version of the old Police Academy flicks .;3
1558;7167;132906;It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .;1
1559;4200;81453;This is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .;1
1560;8533;155877;Proves a servicable World War II drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem Hollywood too long has ignored .;3
1561;1812;38097;I know that I 'll never listen to Marvin Gaye or the Supremes the same way again;3
1562;6565;122422;A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .;2
1563;6140;115263;Even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general 's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy .;3

1568;112;2930;And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest .;1
1569;1110;24415;What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .;0
1570;6090;114474;It 's Tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too .;1

1576;1514;32271;Terry is a sort of geriatric Dirty Harry , which will please Eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man .;3
1577;753;17349;It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .;3
1578;5128;97928;Austin Powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later .;3

1590;6491;121221;Compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , RunTelDat is something of a triumph .;3
1591;4406;85188;The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .;1
1592;2578;52178;We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .;1
1593;4704;90388;Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .;1

1595;4671;89760;Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .;1
1596;5946;112023;Full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing .;4

1615;8071;148322;A well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature .;4
1616;6032;113470;an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades;1

1648;8440;154405;Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .;1
1649;2729;54807;It never is , not fully .;2
1650;340;8198;"Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .";1
1651;3348;65992;What 's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director 's talent .;4
1652;3372;66442;Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market .;2
1653;131;3516;Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .;1
1654;7929;145834;It 's definitely an improvement on the first Blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously .;3
1655;2416;49374;If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .;0
1656;387;9262;`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .;2
1657;5819;109850;Grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length;1
1658;8339;152796;Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .;1
1659;5795;109419;This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .;1
1660;8412;153967;Yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .;1
1661;4414;85351;It 's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns De Palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s .;3
1662;197;5030;If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .;1
1663;4539;87477;A touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an Italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes .;3
1664;111;2895;Takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny .;2
1665;420;9996;plays like some corny television production from a bygone era;1
1666;4083;79279;Both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter .;3
1667;3315;65429;A rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children 's television .;1
1668;1153;25232;Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .;1
1669;7544;139163;Spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don ' t know an Orc from a Uruk-Hai .;4
1670;8458;154675;Or that the battery on your watch has died .;2
1671;6572;122532;Your response to its new sequel , Analyze That , may hinge on what you thought of the first film .;2
1672;2051;42547;Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .;2
1673;6212;116508;Just how these families interact may surprise you .;2
1674;8093;148762;A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .;4
1675;3846;74985;Adults , other than the parents ... will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild .;1
1676;32;849;Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .;0
1677;2939;58295;If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .;1
1678;3330;65705;Technically and artistically inept .;1
1679;4676;89842;Recoing 's fantastic performance does n't exactly reveal what makes Vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat .;2
1680;3064;60662;a joyous occasion;4
1681;7159;132766;It thankfully goes easy on the reel\/real world dichotomy that -LRB- Jaglom -RRB- pursued with such enervating determination in Venice\/Venice .;3
1682;4572;87992;-LRB- Jeff 's -RRB- gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by Neil Finn and Edmund McWilliams 's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent .;3
1683;6707;124806;The film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .;4
1684;1297;28192;A gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the Iranian new wave .;2
1685;5046;96600;Director Paul Cox 's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing Nijinsky 's diaries is both stimulating and demanding .;3
1686;3266;64524;-LRB- Siegel -RRB- and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie .;1
1687;8288;151896;Renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance .;4
1688;8466;154770;Consider it ` perfection . ';4
1689;5495;104166;... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? '';0
1690;394;9465;As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .;4
1691;3790;74062;Maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while .;3
1692;5540;104900;It looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships .;3
1693;8437;154359;The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from Spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable .;3
1694;8261;151479;A rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and Japanese animation .;3
1695;4817;92480;The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .;1
1696;3313;65407;A moving and solidly entertaining comedy\/drama that should bolster director and co-writer;4
1697;2822;56282;A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling .;4
1698;3132;61927;There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .;0
1699;5766;108915;It 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks .;2
1700;4223;81848;Many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , -LRB- yet -RRB- are worthwhile .;2
1701;2873;57050;Pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance .;3
1702;415;9904;But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them .;3
1703;3971;77206;The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .;1
1704;6548;122168;All in all , a great party .;3
1705;3731;73053;There is greatness here .;4
1706;6818;126803;More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .;2
1707;1923;40141;Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of Hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .;1
1708;1426;30653;"DeMeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material .";2
1709;5313;101094;The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .;0
1710;1877;39314;The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .;4
1711;4482;86551;According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .;3
1712;80;2087;An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud .;4
1713;34;917;There 's very little sense to what 's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash .;2
1714;7665;141316;He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .;1
1715;2442;49800;Indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions .;3
1716;603;13990;Writer and director Otar Iosseliani 's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in Venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls .;4
1717;2200;45252;A flawed but engrossing thriller .;3
1718;2958;58681;These characters become wearisome .;1
1719;2821;56265;When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .;0
1720;943;21072;This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon .;3
1721;6096;114569;The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .;1
1722;7247;134320;an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle , seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times , then found its sweet spot;2
1723;574;13343;The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .;1
1724;7719;142278;Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .;1
1725;2331;47822;All of it works smoothly under the direction of Spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely .;4
1726;8522;155700;Exhilarating , funny and fun .;4
1727;4350;84194;But this is Lohman 's film .;2
1728;3181;62863;Australian filmmaker David Flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them .;4
1729;4896;93849;It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !;0
1730;5996;112896;The storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of Gosford Park have come to assume is just another day of Brit cinema .;3
1731;5278;100574;Unlike lots of Hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises .;3
1732;7542;139135;One thing you have to give them credit for : The message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company 's previous video work .;3
1733;3002;59528;Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .;1
1734;5009;95851;Implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most American of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest Hollywood document of all .;3
1735;4517;87075;Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .;0
1736;570;13233;Nair and writer Laura Cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .;2
1737;4221;81791;Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .;1
1738;55;1506;Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is .;4
1739;4317;83521;A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .;0
1740;3627;71090;The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .;0
1741;7082;131443;A mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama .;3
1742;5399;102572;Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .;1
1743;2291;47007;Just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .;1
1744;3319;65528;Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .;0
1745;6462;120770;The story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic .;3
1746;2341;47994;More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .;1
1747;2673;53836;If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .;1
1748;6150;115419;Once again , director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .;1
1749;2180;44938;Speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life .;4
1750;3215;63518;A powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man 's dying fall .;4
1751;3359;66240;The gorgeously elaborate continuation of `` The Lord of the Rings '' trilogy is so huge that a column of words can not adequately describe co-writer\/director Peter Jackson 's expanded vision of J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle-earth .;4
1752;4698;90261;The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .;4
1753;5124;97866;Feeble comedy .;1
1754;1436;30847;The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .;4
1755;895;20133;It 's all a rather shapeless good time ...;2
1756;6667;124183;Quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to .;4
1757;4668;89710;Late Marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love .;3
1758;5042;96502;It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .;2
1759;1269;27639;Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .;3
1760;8104;148950;Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .;1
1761;5467;103652;While it can be a bit repetitive , overall it 's an entertaining and informative documentary .;3
1762;6945;129153;Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .;0
1763;2282;46857;More tiring than anything .;1
1764;8158;149819;The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .;0
1765;1168;25543;I wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` Slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but I laughed so much that I did n't mind .;2
1766;5803;109539;... unbearably lame .;0
1767;4911;94125;Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .;2
1768;6540;121995;The powder blues and sun-splashed whites of Tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs .;3
1769;6769;125996;Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .;1
1770;2270;46637;A fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it .;4
1771;6469;120887;Young Hanks and Fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work .;4
1772;7002;130015;A sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old Welsh boy more curious about God than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter .;3
1773;3550;69821;Holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .;2
1774;373;8939;Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .;2
1775;4982;95403;Shallow .;1
1776;1262;27475;unpretentious , charming , quirky , original;4
1777;4471;86351;The work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them .;3
1778;5858;110534;The case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause .;4
1779;649;15087;It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .;0
1780;4289;83100;To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .;0
1781;2498;50773;A minor work yet there 's no denying the potency of Miller 's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure .;2
1782;5398;102555;There may have been a good film in `` Trouble Every Day , '' but it is not what is on the screen .;1
1783;2717;54608;Fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .;4
1784;6738;125392;A suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .;3
1785;6029;113441;Excellent performances from Jacqueline Bisset and Martha Plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama .;4
1786;7677;141486;This cinema verite speculation on the assassination of John F. Kennedy may have been inspired by Blair Witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative .;3
1787;4218;81766;A hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic French nuance .;2
1788;2733;54863;Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks , but not anyone else .;2
1789;2732;54853;But fans of the show should not consider this a diss .;2
1790;6683;124408;This is the stuff that Disney movies are made of .;3
1791;1220;26602;This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .;0
1792;8016;147312;Romantic comedy and Dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here .;4
1793;5351;101657;The script boasts some tart TV-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .;1
1794;5729;108274;A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .;0
1795;6207;116393;The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .;1
1796;1200;26196;A timid , soggy near miss .;1
1797;6394;119586;If Ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .;3
1798;5920;111560;Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .;1
1799;5096;97426;Alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life .;3
1800;265;6660;In fact , even better .;3
1801;3537;69569;Kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope .;3
1802;577;13398;We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .;0
1803;5235;99773;Tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .;3
1804;5682;107519;Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .;1
1805;7601;140103;When the violence actually shocked ?;2
1806;3149;62287;Imagine -LRB- if possible -RRB- a Pasolini film without passion or politics , or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching O Fantasma .;0
1807;7733;142476;An extraordinarily silly thriller .;2
1808;7190;133266;We get the comedy we settle for .;1
1809;8107;148983;Since Dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .;1
1810;2081;43090;There are plenty of scenes in Frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .;3
1811;6948;129198;A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .;0
1812;6967;129564;Tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun .;3
1813;5328;101349;This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .;1
1814;6545;122121;What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .;0
1815;3446;67860;Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .;1
1816;4564;87886;And in a sense , that 's a liability .;1
1817;4210;81617;It 's about time .;2
1818;1667;35419;But what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .;4
1819;4418;85417;An often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century .;3
1820;7298;135194;An absorbing and unsettling psychological drama .;3
1821;4641;89281;Either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks .;2

1823;888;20023;Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .;4
1824;7917;145635;`` 13 Conversations '' holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point .;2
1825;4056;78808;This is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style .;4
1826;4124;80028;In capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .;2
1827;4454;86045;Your taste for Jonah - A Veggie Tales Movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the Holy Spirit .;2

1830;2807;56084;This is not an easy film .;1
1831;4872;93438;A thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses Grant 's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos .;4
1832;4574;88058;I can analyze this movie in three words : Thumbs Friggin ' Down .;0
1833;5664;107177;Its story about a young Chinese woman , Ah Na , who has come to New York City to replace past tragedy with the American Dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling .;3
1834;8485;155041;Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .;3
1835;6486;121100;Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .;1
1836;7681;141561;What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .;1
1837;1414;30453;For almost the first two-thirds of Martin Scorsese 's 168-minute Gangs of New York , I was entranced .;3
1838;1021;22584;The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .;4
