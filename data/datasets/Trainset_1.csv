791;678;15797;-- but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I 've had in a while .;4
792;4450;86002;Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .;3
793;7459;137836;A passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .;2
794;5751;108652;Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .;1
795;7379;136466;The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .;0
796;2584;52275;Spend your Benjamins on a matinee .;2
797;3555;69896;An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus .;0
798;7217;133748;The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .;2
799;572;13287;Audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling .;4
800;1077;23699;If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , Jacquot preserves Tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .;3
801;842;19191;After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .;1
802;5188;98917;It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .;1
803;4991;95579;A poignant comedy that offers food for thought .;4
804;6883;127943;It 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought .;3
805;6239;116939;Most haunting about `` Fence '' is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen .;4
806;6951;129249;Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .;0
807;5616;106368;Hard to resist .;3
808;916;20508;Worth catching for Griffiths ' warm and winning central performance .;3
809;1156;25283;Reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` Signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen .;3
810;7603;140112;Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film .;2
811;5537;104832;With amazing finesse , the film shadows Heidi 's trip back to Vietnam and the city where her mother , Mai Thi Kim , still lives .;3
812;6750;125629;A sexy , surprising romance ... Idemoto and Kim make a gorgeous pair ... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger .;4
813;4;117;A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .;3
814;2826;56354;The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .;3
815;2590;52375;Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . ';1
816;3099;61310;The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .;1
817;8113;149097;It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .;0
818;7430;137303;Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .;1
819;3808;74321;"The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .";1
820;318;7806;It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .;4
821;3379;66578;Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .;1
822;1538;32821;There are a couple of things that elevate `` Glory '' above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of Duvall .;3
823;7374;136386;A surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of Hollywood 's comic-book adaptations .;3
824;5662;107156;Nicole Kidman makes it a party worth attending .;4
825;5714;107997;Watching The Powerpuff Girls Movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in Japan that gave people seizures .;3
826;6981;129732;Will you go ape over this movie ?;2
827;1594;33930;What you end up getting is the Vertical Limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .;2
828;7083;131455;Ana 's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she 's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her Rubenesque physique ...;2
829;5461;103551;Sorority Boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .;0
830;5036;96403;Parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place .;1
831;1075;23665;A clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film ...;1
832;6906;128346;Eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you do n't care who fires the winning shot .;0
833;5671;107311;The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .;1
834;6607;123083;UB equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are .;3
835;7947;146130;... flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags .;3
836;1439;30907;Alas , another breathless movie about same !;2
837;4616;88849;The film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence .;4
838;8315;152383;And second , what 's with all the shooting ?;1
839;6601;122973;Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .;1
840;6534;121914;This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater;0
841;5840;110280;It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .;0
842;3536;69561;Flawed , but worth seeing for Ambrose 's performance .;2
843;1624;34554;The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance .;3
844;2358;48308;No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .;1
845;6324;118390;It must be in the genes .;2
846;5708;107922;Its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .;1
847;3156;62421;In its own way;2
848;2791;55796;A graceful , moving tribute to the courage of New York 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice .;4
849;7271;134709;They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .;2
850;440;10450;Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .;1
851;5063;96860;Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .;1
852;5406;102636;This is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce .;3
853;2440;49738;Combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration .;3
854;4149;80540;Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with Cage 's best acting .;2
855;612;14193;... -LRB- the film -RRB- works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .;3
856;5078;97132;Hate it because it 's lousy .;0
857;7520;138751;Ca n't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ?;2
858;1104;24299;Although commentary on Nachtwey is provided ... it 's the image that really tells the tale .;3
859;8235;151080;Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .;0
860;4550;87617;Ali 's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier .;2
861;7388;136652;Sad nonsense , this .;1
862;578;13434;Mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .;4
863;2825;56345;This is a film living far too much in its own head .;1
864;6082;114358;What bubbles up out of John C. Walsh 's Pipe Dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch .;3
865;1003;22303;Wait to see it then .;1
866;1203;26254;The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .;2
867;4535;87421;The series ' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls ' amusing personalities .;3
868;4686;90050;No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .;0
869;4352;84214;Constantly slips from the grasp of its maker .;0
870;7133;132297;Serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that The Road to Perdition leads to a satisfying destination .;4
871;1556;33191;A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .;2
872;5782;109191;A conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in Ireland over a man 's right to raise his own children .;3
873;2936;58257;He gets his secretary to fax it . '';2
874;576;13381;Fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .;2
875;3394;66886;By that measure , it is a failure .;0
876;6585;122730;Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .;1
877;8402;153825;A good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold .;3
878;4190;81271;They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .;0
879;5483;103964;Berling and;2
880;6872;127781;Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .;1
881;3794;74102;The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .;0
882;3636;71270;Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .;2
883;1981;41276;So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .;0
884;5040;96458;Not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made .;3
885;8263;151501;Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .;0
886;2585;52282;... a lesson in prehistoric hilarity .;2
887;92;2394;... it 's as comprehensible as any Dummies guide , something even non-techies can enjoy .;3
888;8194;150394;It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .;0
889;6913;128509;Berry 's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making `` Die Another Day '' one of the most entertaining Bonds in years;4
890;2704;54395;The re-release of Ron Howard 's Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .;3
891;8053;147961;This masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short .;3
892;2613;52753;No , it 's not as single-minded as John Carpenter 's original , but it 's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels .;3

899;6217;116575;Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look .;3
900;8119;149207;As happily glib and vicious as its characters .;2
901;4323;83635;An exhilarating serving of movie fluff .;2
902;1346;29059;Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .;1

904;5454;103428;One of the greatest films I 've ever seen .;4
905;5964;112301;The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .;2
906;8264;151517;The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .;1
907;5013;95936;It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .;4
908;356;8587;This is no `` Waterboy ! '';1
909;1878;39334;Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .;1

914;5623;106463;Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .;1
915;3634;71207;Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .;0
916;4315;83495;Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .;2
917;6305;118030;Witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful .;4
918;2843;56597;Originality ai n't on the menu , but there 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller .;3

1012;7870;144917;Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .;2

1030;6837;127115;The determination of Pinochet 's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director Patricio Guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop .;4
