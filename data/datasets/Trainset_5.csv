4460;2856;56827;True Hollywood Story .;2
4461;2607;52643;A complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son 's home after decades away .;3
4462;5026;96203;It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .;1
4463;3706;72540;Thoroughly enjoyable .;3
4464;8028;147520;While the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .;1
4465;3920;76316;One of the film 's most effective aspects is its Tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret .;2
4466;7465;137977;for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience;0
4467;4456;86069;both overstuffed and undernourished ... The film ca n't be called a solid success , although there 's plenty of evidence here to indicate Clooney might have better luck next time .;2
4468;7052;130865;Remember it .;3
4469;1232;26844;Blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in Kieran Culkin a pitch-perfect Holden .;4
4470;6923;128705;Ryan Gosling ... is at 22 a powerful young actor .;4
4471;156;4124;In the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .;3
4472;1374;29646;The filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching .;3
4473;6674;124269;Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .;1
4474;1589;33799;Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .;2
4475;6004;113061;Offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through .;3
4476;1653;35158;It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .;0
4477;6660;124052;A romance ?;2
4478;5622;106439;It 's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads .;1
4479;3114;61611;Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .;0
4480;6379;119325;is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .;1
4481;4023;78181;It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .;0
4482;4377;84598;It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .;0
4483;5523;104577;If Mr. Zhang 's subject matter is , to some degree at least , quintessentially American , his approach to storytelling might be called Iranian .;2
4484;4466;86239;Suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands .;0
4485;2595;52444;The movie is well crafted , and well executed .;4
4486;1464;31315;Insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it does n't disgrace it , either .;2
4487;3296;65145;A bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale .;3
4488;5275;100532;Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .;1
4489;7322;135561;Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal ';2
4490;691;16062;A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .;2
4491;7842;144420;But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .;1
4492;7163;132838;The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .;2
4493;2820;56242;This is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party .;3
4494;7478;138188;Ryan Gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted Daniel .;4
4495;6425;120121;As they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , Signs is a tribute to Shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project .;3
4496;5314;101108;can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included;1
4497;4419;85437;For his first attempt at film noir , Spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future .;3
4498;6865;127620;Even if you do n't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why .;3

4501;5851;110448;It may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate .;2
4502;854;19481;A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .;2
4503;4429;85649;Whatever one makes of its political edge , this is beautiful filmmaking from one of French cinema 's master craftsmen .;4
4504;1309;28353;The premise of Jason X is silly but strangely believable .;3
4505;8023;147441;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .;2
4506;6802;126486;A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .;0
4507;7873;144974;It 's that painful .;0
4508;3041;60235;It 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie .;3
4509;8112;149078;Vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores .;3
4510;1396;30057;The movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds .;3
4511;5504;104318;Michael Moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he 's got as potent a topic as ever here .;3
4512;3528;69392;Caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose .;3
4513;8323;152534;Merci pour le movie .;2
4514;3784;73982;I encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale 's tale -- you wo n't be sorry !;4
4515;7187;133213;Visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure .;4
4516;7548;139249;Surprisingly powerful and universal .;4
4517;1835;38505;Intriguing and stylish .;4
4518;1805;37946;She 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .;4
4519;2605;52596;Adam Sandler 's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash .;0
4520;5747;108593;Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .;2
4521;1152;25183;Would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial New Yorker if 26-year-old Reese Witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , Melanie Carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned Hollywood magic .;3
4522;8279;151727;Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .;4
4523;6522;121708;Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .;1
4524;4960;95096;No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .;0
4525;7056;130906;Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .;2
4526;2526;51299;The origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books .;2
4527;7845;144498;More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine;1
4528;119;3151;The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , B movie way , they succeed .;3
4529;1185;25869;A live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .;4
4530;6909;128417;The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .;0
4531;7952;146243;A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . ';0
4532;6166;115698;Turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a ` very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing\/reappearing acts;4
4533;7841;144418;It sucked .;0
4534;5154;98337;Eric Byler 's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations ...;2
4535;7024;130385;Visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably Mexican and burns its Kahlories with conviction .;3
4536;4058;78845;The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .;1
4537;6610;123150;This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .;1
4538;4364;84384;Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .;0
4539;2952;58578;It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .;2
4540;3853;75140;Together writer-director Danny Verete 's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt .;3
4541;1665;35413;It is a movie about passion .;2
4542;8088;148667;The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .;3
4543;463;10872;A wry , affectionate delight .;4
4544;4467;86257;It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .;1
4545;5952;112115;Jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera 's drama and lyricism .;3
4546;6078;114280;, Skins has its heart in the right place;2
4547;6119;114899;The story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy .;3
4548;5473;103816;Splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity .;3
4549;7116;132013;Gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways .;4
4550;2738;54959;Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a;1
4551;5855;110502;A dashing and absorbing outing with one of France 's most inventive directors .;3
4552;8199;150469;The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .;0
4553;2998;59426;What makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music .;3
4554;158;4185;Eerily accurate depiction of depression .;1
4555;923;20669;Satin Rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it 's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .;3
4556;3322;65577;They were right .;2
4557;5282;100613;Too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper -LRB- and better -RRB- than Pink Floyd tickets .;3
4558;4063;78970;The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .;3
4559;2206;45382;A delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , Mostly Martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach .;3
4560;7559;139403;The movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .;2
4561;1990;41393;I liked About Schmidt a lot , but I have a feeling that I would have liked it much more if Harry & Tonto never existed .;3
4562;3103;61391;Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .;1
4563;5122;97828;It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .;1
4564;2402;49155;A diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of Palestinian and Israeli children .;3
4565;7799;143695;Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .;1
4566;4551;87642;There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure .;4
4567;2944;58424;I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .;0
4568;7006;130081;The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .;1
4569;4340;83997;Even with Harris 's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear 's soul-stripping breakdown .;2
4570;1059;23343;The new Insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .;3
4571;4516;87074;Wishy-washy .;1
4572;3899;75975;A little better than Sorcerer 's Stone .;3

4574;191;4912;The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire and you wo n't be disappointed .;3
4575;4614;88815;A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita .;1
4576;6944;129128;It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .;1
4577;243;6077;At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon .;3
4578;5805;109559;An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .;1
4579;6599;122956;You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell .;1
4580;5143;98155;I like this movie a lot .;4
4581;5942;111945;The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .;1
4582;4556;87747;There 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence .;3
4583;3226;63703;High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .;1
4584;6760;125825;A strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet .;4
4585;8450;154555;This method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .;4
4586;1810;38049;-LRB- Shyamalan -RRB- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .;3
4587;3349;66007;... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . ';1
4588;3303;65254;They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book .;1
4589;938;20985;The whole affair is as predictable as can be .;2
4590;1691;35833;Offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film .;4
4591;5852;110470;Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .;1
4592;6936;128981;I 'm guessing the director is a magician .;3
4593;1897;39720;A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .;1
4594;2278;46778;A pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro .;4
4595;2545;51622;A very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the World Trade Center tragedy .;3
4596;523;12228;Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .;3
4597;2635;53124;An unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood .;3

4601;7658;141187;For the most part , the film does hold up pretty well .;3
4602;826;18800;A remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive Eisenhower era about one suburban woman 's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life .;3

4625;7630;140616;By no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story .;1
4626;7695;141843;The film 's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political Blair Witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .;2

4669;5382;102265;Much of this slick and sprightly CGI feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings .;3
4670;5237;99800;Nicole Holofcener 's Lovely and Amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style .;4

4674;5296;100815;Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .;3
4675;4667;89672;Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .;1
4676;6766;125944;Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .;1
4677;7126;132169;The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .;1

4688;7649;141018;What saves it ... and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist Alice .;3
4689;8089;148675;Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss .;3

4691;1340;28920;Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .;1

4700;4421;85474;K-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of Man confronting the Demons of his own fear and paranoia .;3

4702;4384;84752;It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .;3

4706;4100;79636;It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .;2
4707;3701;72409;It 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries .;3
4708;5826;109994;It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .;2

4710;4037;78472;The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in .;2
4711;2272;46670;The director , Mark Pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head .;3

4746;6703;124730;It 's the type of stunt the Academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .;2
4747;6352;118856;The pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother , Donald , and directed by Spike Jonze .;3

4752;772;17791;Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .;4

4770;2774;55546;Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?;0
4771;4661;89612;Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .;2
4772;8337;152768;A beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps Dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions .;3
4773;3903;76061;The main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .;1
4774;6528;121822;There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .;1
4775;5903;111317;Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .;0
4776;2805;56065;The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .;1
4777;8156;149800;An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .;0
4778;5270;100450;The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from Japan , the characters move with grace and panache .;4
4779;7366;136246;Both flawed and delayed , Martin Scorcese 's Gangs of New York still emerges as his most vital work since GoodFellas .;2
4780;2150;44351;A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .;1
4781;5770;108989;And for many of us , that 's good enough .;3
4782;6293;117848;Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment .;2
4783;3434;67627;Despite the film 's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving .;3
4784;6315;118221;This is n't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work .;2
4785;5344;101574;This New Zealand coming-of-age movie is n't really about anything .;1

4795;8179;150155;A remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .;3
4796;1010;22389;Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation .;1

4802;4718;90635;the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .;2
4803;3449;67919;A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .;1

4808;6415;119939;An Inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds .;4
4809;6430;120251;Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?;1

4850;6838;127146;Writer\/director Alexander Payne -LRB- Election -RRB- and his co-writer Jim Taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look American angst in the eye and end up laughing .;3

4852;7758;142925;A penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic .;2
4853;5342;101559;A deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams .;4

4856;832;18943;Decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like .;2
4857;6426;120151;Instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many Barney videos .;1

4865;3100;61333;It also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them .;3
4866;6718;124996;This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .;1

4875;8453;154598;Maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .;4
4876;8484;155028;It made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters .;3
4877;6299;117921;The result is more depressing than liberating , but it 's never boring .;2

4879;633;14679;Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .;1
4880;6042;113651;It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .;1

4913;8386;153561;By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .;0
4914;6586;122756;I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray Richard Dawson .;4

4922;3416;67320;By its modest , straight-ahead standards , Undisputed scores a direct hit .;3
4923;672;15654;The Hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame .;3

4936;7293;135097;Schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .;1
4937;3043;60255;But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .;0
4938;4912;94131;It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .;2
4939;467;10932;Despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .;3

4945;3908;76171;Awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful;4
4946;6182;115965;Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic .;0
4947;3476;68504;Overall , it 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : God is love .;4
4948;5476;103868;But not a whit more .;2
4949;2558;51849;A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .;2
4950;7361;136185;In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .;0
4951;5839;110254;This is a nervy , risky film , and Villeneuve has inspired Croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of Bibi .;2

4956;4992;95587;About as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life .;2
4957;4729;90896;A movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action TV series .;2
4958;338;8169;One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .;0
4959;5798;109467;An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .;0

4962;8384;153508;A powerful performance from Mel Gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an M-16 .;4
4963;8322;152507;The message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .;2

4971;2916;57866;a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing;3
4972;8509;155451;The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .;3
4973;2989;59222;... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .;0
4974;3441;67746;There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .;1
4975;8432;154285;A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .;0
4976;3093;61184;Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .;1

4979;7112;131932;A moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives .;3
4980;6447;120554;The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .;0
4981;5659;107105;This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .;0
4982;1463;31308;Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .;1
4983;549;12740;Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .;1
4984;6490;121203;The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .;1
4985;1363;29405;What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .;0
4986;6076;114242;The Saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and The Quiet American brings us right into the center of that world .;3
4987;5016;96002;Bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .;2
4988;1045;23073;All the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable .;2
4989;2906;57619;All right , so it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny -LRB- sometimes hilarious -RRB- comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast .;3
4990;7036;130573;An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .;1
4991;1794;37715;... a bland , pretentious mess .;1
4992;148;3890;Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .;1
4993;3261;64410;A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .;2
4994;6995;129934;If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .;0
4995;7311;135374;Just as the recent Argentine film Son of the Bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , Time of Favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain .;3
4996;8382;153461;harmlessly;3
4997;4422;85509;Angel presents events partly from the perspective of Aurelie and Christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale .;3

4999;2773;55542;Would I see it again ?;2

5012;3904;76085;Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .;1

5015;6455;120685;The film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .;1
5016;3293;65088;The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .;1
5017;4031;78335;This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers .;2
5018;3849;75049;The acting in Pauline And Paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is Debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons .;4

5110;5980;112604;What -LRB- Frei -RRB- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .;3
