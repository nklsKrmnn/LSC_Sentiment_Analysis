5430;2437;49699;Broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary .;3
5431;7713;142163;A very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be .;3

5447;4612;88759;This odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in Morton 's ever-watchful gaze -- and it 's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .;4
5448;1244;27057;This is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its Freud and knows its Sade .;3
5449;6659;124032;The cast is top-notch and I predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over Michael Idemoto as Michael .;4
5450;4290;83118;Ludicrous , but director Carl Franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining .;3
5451;1932;40364;It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .;1

5453;5543;104921;From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten;0
5454;3911;76214;As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .;0
5455;3591;70440;A well-acted , but one-note film .;2
5456;3774;73780;We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .;1
5457;7320;135546;There 's nothing to gain from watching They .;0
5458;7164;132868;A venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director 's understanding of the expressive power of the camera .;4
5459;1882;39393;A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .;0
5460;7753;142859;This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .;1
5461;7890;145192;A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .;1
5462;6035;113503;I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .;0
5463;7392;136705;Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .;1
5464;5008;95841;If you go , pack your knitting needles .;0
5465;3831;74719;Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .;0
5466;1626;34584;Quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and Moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between Jane Wyman and June Cleaver .;3
5467;6841;127204;It manages to squeeze by on Angelina Jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy .;3
5468;1832;38450;This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .;0
5469;5801;109513;Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .;2
5470;3532;69474;Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original .;2
5471;810;18459;-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-America diversions could ever be .;3
5472;1953;40751;Anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning .;1
5473;3709;72616;The strength of the film lies in its two central performances by Sven Wollter as the stricken composer and Viveka Seldahl as his desperate violinist wife .;3
5474;117;3099;Devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower .;3
5475;5607;106168;An affectionately goofy satire that 's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary ...;3
5476;7343;135924;There are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers do n't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies .;3
5477;7763;143007;We get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle .;2
5478;3984;77441;Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .;1
5479;4873;93459;Spielberg 's picture is smarter and subtler than -LRB- Total Recall and Blade Runner -RRB- , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .;3
5480;5948;112052;May seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman .;2
5481;1080;23749;The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .;1
5482;7230;133989;Worthy of the gong .;1
5483;4437;85763;An easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .;2
5484;1127;24721;The Sundance Film Festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon Utah each January to ferret out The Next Great Thing .;2
5485;538;12543;There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .;3
5486;1513;32257;Deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .;4
5487;4561;87801;With each of her three protagonists , Miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path .;4
5488;918;20557;While this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that 's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .;2
5489;5033;96353;There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .;1
5490;8459;154684;Competently directed but terminally cute drama .;3
5491;6227;116761;Cube 's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche .;2
5492;4212;81638;The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .;2
5493;1650;35087;Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White 's dry wit to a new age .;4
5494;7180;133131;Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series .;1
5495;4474;86424;When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo , it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W.;1
5496;4339;83967;A gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative Hollywood practices .;3
5497;2890;57342;The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .;3
5498;5576;105592;Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .;0
5499;2564;51967;Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and I know this because I 've seen ` jackass : the movie . ';0
5500;2159;44568;Could have been crisper and punchier , but it 's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies .;3
5501;2482;50464;This is a third-person story now , told by Hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .;1
5502;5149;98241;If you 're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with Jason X.;3
5503;1818;38220;And people make fun of me for liking Showgirls .;1

5506;6920;128644;Whatever complaints I might have , I 'd take -LRB- its -RRB- earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like Antwone Fisher or The Emperor 's Club any time .;3
5507;2748;55116;Good performances keep it from being a total rehash .;3
5508;8222;150839;`` On Guard ! '';2
5509;1212;26418;Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .;1

5511;6477;120974;Psychologically savvy .;3
5512;1175;25716;An intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time .;3
5513;5982;112648;This new movie version of the Alexandre Dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit .;3
5514;8145;149626;The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .;2
5515;2750;55148;The modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals .;1
5516;670;15628;Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there;2

5518;5564;105356;Vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two English women .;2
5519;3861;75256;A comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising .;4
5520;4440;85802;Crudup 's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families .;3
5521;2303;47253;Starts slowly , but Adrien Brody -- in the title role -- helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying .;3
5522;3227;63743;Anybody who enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed .;3
5523;1354;29235;Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .;2
5524;2926;58070;Fulfills the minimum requirement of Disney animation .;2
5525;6047;113763;To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .;0
5526;276;6886;Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .;1
5527;8468;154799;This is a more fascinating look at the future than `` Bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen .;3

5530;2267;46573;Muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they do n't have , and how this gets us in trouble .;3

5532;7393;136727;Never once predictable .;3
5533;4029;78313;Like Brosnan 's performance , Evelyn comes from the heart .;4
5534;5814;109727;Like The Rugrats movies , The Wild Thornberrys Movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .;3

5537;1027;22683;It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .;1
5538;2645;53279;The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .;1
5539;7587;139800;The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . ';2

5541;5864;110641;Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .;1

5569;7726;142378;The production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other .;4
5570;5969;112391;It 's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look .;3
5571;6719;125031;A creaky staircase gothic .;2
5572;4563;87836;There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -LRB- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -RRB- , but `` Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .;4
5573;8273;151645;Shanghai Ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life .;3
5574;823;18754;Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .;1

5576;1912;39986;At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .;4
5577;1264;27515;The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .;1

5584;1171;25633;A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .;0

5600;6405;119757;The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . ';1
5601;3201;63287;A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .;0

5609;4838;92880;The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .;0
5610;7930;145849;But mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived .;4
5611;2130;43936;The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .;4

5616;1886;39491;Texan director George Ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .;4

5625;2479;50415;Victor Rosa is Leguizamo 's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance .;4
5626;6437;120385;The problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .;1
5627;2691;54174;Whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini DV , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .;4
5628;1236;26931;Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .;1

5631;1751;36945;Directed with purpose and finesse by England 's Roger Mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as Notting Hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft .;4

5636;4388;84838;Like an episode of MTV 's Undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance ... indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper .;2
5637;5512;104441;Aside from Rohmer 's bold choices regarding point of view , The Lady and the Duke represents the filmmaker 's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art .;3

5642;1614;34374;It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .;2
5643;7284;134949;It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .;1
5644;7151;132605;A gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn Jerusalem .;3
5645;2596;52450;It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .;4
5646;2242;46109;There 's already been too many of these films ...;0
5647;7642;140888;A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .;0

5653;1415;30475;A brutally dry satire of Middle American numbness .;1
5654;5005;95783;Streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , `` Big Trouble '' is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter .;2

5656;5559;105281;While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .;2

5662;322;7901;It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .;0

5664;2896;57426;Steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture .;4
5665;3228;63762;A waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .;1

6285;1552;33103;Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .;2
6286;6862;127563;What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .;1
6287;6319;118266;It may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality;3
6288;8454;154612;The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .;2
6289;8139;149526;I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .;0
6290;4565;87894;Both heartbreaking and heartwarming ... just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving .;4
6291;4152;80626;A life-size reenactment of those Jack Chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire .;2
6292;5138;98077;What 's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children .;3
6293;1655;35196;This may be Burns 's strongest film since The Brothers McMullen .;4
6294;3980;77372;Not the Great American Comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too .;3
6295;8209;150608;Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series .;0
6296;1007;22343;Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .;1
6297;981;21932;It drowns in sap .;1
6298;2816;56202;The latest Adam Sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .;0
6299;8164;149912;An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .;2
6300;6117;114875;Lacks dramatic punch and depth .;1
6301;6484;121063;See Scratch for the history , see Scratch for the music , see Scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion .;4
6302;4397;85017;Films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days .;3
6303;2707;54463;My Wife is an Actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy .;4
6304;6820;126836;... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .;1
6305;2045;42430;A special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento ...;4
6306;5582;105729;Schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film 's present with the playful paranoia of the film 's past . ';4
6307;6197;116273;Can you bear the laughter ?;3
6308;4026;78239;recovers;2
6309;2031;42183;A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .;2
6310;6710;124863;Insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion .;1
6311;1577;33596;Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .;4
6312;6494;121276;There 's no reason to miss Interview with the Assassin;4
6313;1609;34234;Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .;2
6314;8220;150812;-LRB- Ferrera -RRB- has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen .;4
6315;5700;107797;It is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .;0
6316;5759;108773;The one not-so-small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .;1
6317;7761;142974;Laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , No Such Thing is a fascinating little tale .;4
6318;4260;82508;The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson ...;4
6319;7011;130214;The film has several strong performances .;3
6320;5004;95778;A witty , low-key romantic comedy .;4
6321;2685;54036;The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .;0
6322;7809;143890;Slap me , I saw this movie .;0
6323;2656;53553;The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia .;0
6324;2799;55954;Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan .;1
6325;5041;96476;True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .;1
6326;1883;39416;Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .;1
6327;6156;115527;Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .;1
6328;5536;104829;A remarkable film by Bernard Rose .;4
6329;1055;23278;Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .;0
6330;8187;150311;What Jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery;1
6331;7757;142913;Not as good as The Full Monty , but a really strong second effort .;3
6332;5710;107955;The film is flat .;1
6333;8508;155428;As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .;0
6334;7976;146623;Kinnear and Dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers .;4
6335;6725;125119;While Cherish does n't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it 's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem .;3
6336;5055;96777;Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .;1
6337;4784;91944;lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .;1
6338;3952;76843;Far From Heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it 's a work of enthralling drama .;3
6339;5093;97373;Canada 's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the Inuit people .;3
6340;181;4729;The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .;1
6341;575;13366;Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .;2
6342;3887;75800;The rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it 's based .;4
6343;7560;139415;A classy , sprightly spin on film .;4
6344;4199;81442;Like the best 60 Minutes;4
6345;4328;83727;... Pray does n't have a passion for the material .;1
6346;7712;142158;Dramas like this make it human .;4
6347;8231;150989;Though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the Kissinger should be tried as a war criminal .;1
6348;5871;110808;A deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed .;4
6349;5494;104159;Only for young children , if them .;2
6350;3810;74361;The characters never change .;1
6351;4274;82743;A road trip that will get you thinking , ` Are we there yet ? ';2
6352;2311;47403;When Seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , I wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , ` Hey , Kool-Aid ! ';2
6353;7938;145968;An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .;1
6354;586;13654;By no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one .;3
6355;2857;56830;The movie is amateurish , but it 's a minor treat .;3
6356;3014;59768;There is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care .;4
6357;7436;137443;A lame comedy .;0
6358;4186;81222;Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .;1
6359;7704;142001;Unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling .;3
6360;1221;26620;There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .;1
6361;2196;45197;This is the first film I 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .;2
6362;3558;69926;What makes Esther Kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony .;1
6363;4448;85965;One-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation .;1
6364;1306;28311;If you answered yes , by all means enjoy The New Guy .;3
6365;1282;27919;We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .;1
6366;4073;79091;Features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer 's block ever .;4
6367;1460;31251;Jeffrey Tambor 's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is Oscar-worthy .;4
6368;6419;119995;For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson 's Creek , they 'll probably run out screaming .;1
6369;7813;143953;A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .;1
6370;1218;26551;Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !;2
6371;7784;143404;It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .;0
6372;3194;63166;While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere .;2
6373;664;15491;With an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera;3
6374;2547;51659;With so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine .;3
6375;948;21164;It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .;3
6376;2832;56427;Dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch .;2
6377;7796;143639;It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .;0
6378;8424;154156;I had more fun with Ben Stiller 's Zoolander , which I thought was rather clever .;2
6379;1622;34525;A reality-snubbing hodgepodge .;1
6380;1392;30005;A film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure .;3
6381;5147;98217;Manages to delight without much of a story .;3
6382;4890;93762;The movie is ingenious fun .;4
6383;2314;47481;Mr. Deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy .;4
6384;6511;121530;The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .;1
6385;3047;60333;Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .;1
6386;4524;87209;Sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .;2
6387;6409;119813;A shame that Stealing Harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .;0
6388;3693;72244;Showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation .;4
6389;3116;61660;-LRB- Javier Bardem is -RRB- one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director Gerardo Vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .;2
6390;8431;154276;`` ... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time .;0
6391;2829;56417;Mordantly funny and intimately knowing ...;3
6392;8253;151365;A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached .;4
6393;8265;151525;Hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from Alfred Hitchcock 's imaginative flight to Shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff .;1
6394;6614;123195;None of his actors stand out , but that 's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : Characterization matters less than atmosphere .;2
6395;4841;92929;A tightly directed , highly professional film that 's old-fashioned in all the best possible ways .;3
6396;258;6503;Genuinely unnerving .;3
