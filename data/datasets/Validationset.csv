6516;1355;29266;Perhaps the grossest movie ever made .;0
6517;6553;122218;Leigh 's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of Margaret Thatcher 's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other .;2
6518;4740;91105;A damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film .;4
6519;3905;76107;The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .;0

6531;4977;95343;Pascale Bailly 's rom-com;2
6532;3570;70097;An estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote -LRB- and cannier doppelganger -RRB- to Diesel 's XXX flex-a-thon .;2
6533;5530;104692;Meeting , even exceeding expectations , it 's the best sequel since The Empire Strikes Back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth .;4

6535;261;6557;A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .;2

6542;5642;106822;Almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai 's villainous father to the endless action sequences .;2
6543;1607;34184;The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .;0
6544;4779;91823;You feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did .;4
6545;4987;95498;The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .;0
6546;4280;82897;The direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by Harris , Phifer and Cam ` ron seal the deal .;3
6547;3935;76534;The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .;2
6548;5070;96996;A high-minded snoozer .;1

6553;7980;146698;There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .;1
6554;174;4585;Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .;2
6555;4918;94227;Playfully profound ... and crazier than Michael Jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows .;3
6556;7790;143522;If The Tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit Chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .;1
6557;807;18421;Execrable .;0

6559;5797;109455;Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .;1
6560;6179;115925;The results , if not memorable , are at least interesting .;2
6561;1909;39931;A deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph .;3
6562;6668;124196;As an actor 's showcase , Hart 's War has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player .;3
6563;334;8094;Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema .;4
6564;7815;143968;Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .;1
6565;875;19821;An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .;3
6566;3608;70765;Scherfig , who has had a successful career in TV , tackles more than she can handle .;1
6567;8198;150454;I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .;2

6569;4306;83378;... a fairly disposable yet still entertaining B picture .;2
6570;4547;87582;It is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events .;3
6571;7249;134378;every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that I usually dread encountering the most - The Fanboy;3
6572;2837;56488;Formulaic to the 51st power , more like .;1
6573;7783;143392;Ash Wednesday is not Edward Burns ' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film .;3

6575;3173;62747;A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .;1

6578;5780;109138;About as enjoyable , I would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful .;0
6579;6204;116355;It 's a masterpiece .;4
6580;7792;143554;One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before .;1
6581;1813;38116;Like Shrek , Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .;4
6582;2565;52006;Nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one .;4
6583;3785;74005;Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .;1
6584;1742;36747;As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .;0

6591;4923;94312;As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .;1
6592;7370;136317;A respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain Trek films ... cross over to a more mainstream audience .;2

6976;2600;52523;The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful .;2
6977;6972;129620;This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .;1
6978;7429;137289;Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .;2
6979;6579;122643;A weird , arresting little ride .;3
6980;920;20606;An uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , The Grey Zone does have a center , though a morbid one .;0
6981;7268;134664;A documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary .;1
6982;1574;33555;An overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort .;3
6983;6940;129029;Oddly , the film is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny .;3
6984;220;5542;A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .;1
6985;6611;123167;Consummate actor Barry has done excellent work here .;4
6986;5691;107693;Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .;1
6987;7731;142471;Yes .;3
6988;6578;122624;Everything is pegged into the groove of a New York dating comedy with ` issues ' to simplify .;2
6989;1009;22378;is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .;2
6990;6391;119554;A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .;4
6991;4065;78996;Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but `` Spider-Man '' certainly delivers the goods .;4
6992;7021;130332;Soderbergh , like Kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit .;4
6993;5184;98837;Some Body will take you places you have n't been , and also places you have .;3
6994;2237;45994;In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .;1
6995;1961;40915;directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name;2
6996;5944;111974;A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .;0
6997;2528;51323;If Disney 's Cinderella proved that ' a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then Cinderella II proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes .;1
6998;1660;35301;Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . ';1
6999;4610;88747;A faster paced family flick .;3
7000;5522;104575;Nothing about this movie works .;0
7001;1477;31545;With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .;0
7002;6832;127041;A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .;1
7003;4027;78262;The performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart .;3
7004;5569;105447;This dubious product of a college-spawned -LRB- Colgate U. -RRB- comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .;1
7005;1995;41480;An empty , purposeless exercise .;0
7006;3203;63302;This is a movie you can trust .;4
7007;1304;28288;Otherwise , maybe .;2
7008;7072;131203;Although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a Lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of Middle America .;1
7009;6563;122407;Abysmally pathetic;0
7010;3336;65807;Smart and taut .;4
7011;2328;47759;It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .;2
7012;2400;49120;The usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director Michael Apted and writer Tom Stoppard .;3
7013;627;14563;It 's just rather leaden and dull .;0
7014;2813;56147;Jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used .;2
7015;2408;49235;Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .;0
7016;5834;110157;With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .;0
7017;213;5347;When it 's this rich and luscious , who cares ?;3
7018;462;10864;A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .;1
7019;4734;90987;There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid;1
7020;1949;40680;And it is .;3
7021;6420;120018;Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .;0
7022;4240;82164;A rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means .;3
7023;4236;82102;To the degree that ivans xtc .;2
7024;1989;41380;Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .;4
7025;3166;62596;Marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary .;4
7026;74;1973;Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .;2
7027;4544;87563;Intimate and panoramic .;3
7028;8153;149763;It 's still Adam Sandler , and it 's not Little Nicky .;2
7029;478;11122;Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .;2
7030;5145;98193;An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .;0
7031;8002;147005;Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .;1
7032;1525;32540;Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .;2
7033;1167;25503;Director Tom Dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon , but Showtime 's uninspired send-up of TV cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .;3
7034;8037;147698;A flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .;2
7035;7063;131059;Harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .;2
7036;2755;55258;At once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .;4
7037;1014;22453;Solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .;2
7038;838;19115;A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .;1
7039;279;6956;Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .;0
7040;3457;68115;I found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as Vincent became more and more abhorrent .;1
7041;4464;86224;An encouraging effort from McCrudden;3
7042;5475;103848;A fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to Betty Fisher and left out the other stories .;2
7043;5724;108197;Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .;1
7044;1516;32341;It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .;3
7045;718;16632;Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .;1
7046;4452;86039;Brisk hack job .;0
7047;4979;95366;Catch it ... if you can !;3
7048;8095;148792;It is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it .;4
7049;7584;139759;Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .;4
7050;4358;84330;Colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical ... the rare sequel that 's better than its predecessor .;4
7051;1560;33293;So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .;0
7052;1347;29101;While the humor is recognizably Plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time .;3
7053;4540;87500;Spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing .;4
7054;5273;100515;Marinated;2
7055;2513;51041;It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .;2
7056;7279;134854;What 's so striking about Jolie 's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair .;3
7057;3652;71574;The most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from Portugal .;3
7058;8483;155024;A ragbag of cliches .;0
7059;7692;141775;The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -LRB- the characters ' -RRB- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .;1
7060;6251;117153;Efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug .;3
7061;6764;125911;Fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience .;1
7062;4322;83625;Chaiken ably balances real-time rhythms with propulsive incident .;3
7063;5785;109238;Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .;0
7064;1632;34705;Some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the Ball and Chain .;2
7065;5164;98510;No worse a film than Breaking Out , and Breaking Out was utterly charming .;3
7066;5312;101092;He fails .;1
7067;1453;31128;Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .;0
7068;764;17646;It 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .;3
7069;732;16886;If you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart .;3
7070;4770;91675;An escapist confection that 's pure entertainment .;4
7071;8477;154958;Woefully pretentious .;1
7072;2224;45739;Try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes Edward Burns ' Sidewalks of New York look like Oscar Wilde .;1
7073;2714;54573;If you can push on through the slow spots , you 'll be rewarded with some fine acting .;3
7074;6464;120804;The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .;1
7075;1911;39960;Predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director John Stockwell .;3
7076;2504;50879;It 's a masterpeice .;4
7077;8521;155694;A witty , whimsical feature debut .;3
7078;1256;27345;A virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze .;2
7079;2089;43231;... strips Bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults .;3
7080;1158;25344;It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .;1
7081;4662;89616;Can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music;3
7082;1032;22785;The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react .;3
7083;6893;128114;This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .;1
7084;2817;56210;Samuel Beckett applied to the Iranian voting process .;2
7085;1342;28959;Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .;1
7086;521;12173;Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .;0
7087;6743;125489;The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .;2
7088;1321;28591;If only there were one for this kind of movie .;2

7092;6172;115836;`` Juwanna Mann ? '';2
7093;8414;154008;Intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being .;3
7094;3095;61227;If villainous vampires are your cup of blood , Blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest .;3
7095;4797;92180;A surprisingly funny movie .;4
7096;6957;129383;The story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and Mr. Day-Lewis roars with leonine power .;4
7097;4163;80799;Faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , `` A Walk to Remember '' succeeds through sincerity .;3
7098;2484;50494;It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it is n't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers .;3
7099;3673;71926;Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...;0
7100;5542;104912;Some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema .;2
7101;1881;39380;It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .;1
7102;2651;53463;A coming-of-age film;2
7103;6482;121008;An achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .;1
7104;3224;63670;Although What Time offers Tsai 's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films .;4
7105;2313;47463;The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .;4
7106;5639;106764;Brilliantly written and well-acted , Yellow Asphalt is an uncompromising film .;4
7107;7179;133113;This story of a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments .;3
7108;6525;121771;... an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle .;3
7109;443;10501;Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork .;1
7110;138;3649;Although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film does n't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up Catholic or , really , anything .;1
7111;2244;46121;Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .;3
7112;5764;108877;But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .;1
7113;3038;60201;Not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days .;4
7114;7569;139525;It is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters .;4
7115;3431;67601;There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .;0
7116;8065;148201;On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .;1
7117;866;19671;The sword fighting is well done and Auteuil is a goofy pleasure .;3
7118;6892;128102;I liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive .;3
7119;743;17109;With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .;1
7120;4262;82557;A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .;1
7121;983;21951;A solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude .;4
7122;8392;153676;One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .;1
7123;1879;39361;Why ?;1
7124;3988;77534;Your stomach for Heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn .;2
7125;8151;149726;Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .;1
7126;4217;81733;The movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , Rocky-like moments ... but it 's such a warm and charming package that you 'll feel too happy to argue much .;2
7127;707;16424;Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine .;2
7128;6113;114831;classic cinema served up with heart and humor;4
7129;4958;95051;These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .;1
7130;7958;146335;Hollywood Ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless .;3
7131;5817;109792;It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .;0
7132;1701;36056;Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles .;4
7133;4782;91890;Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .;0
7134;6485;121089;A Rumor of Angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .;0
7135;7959;146346;If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .;0
7136;3565;70020;I found The Ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .;3
7137;2422;49476;Koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager 's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation .;3
7138;7401;136834;Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .;0
7139;8034;147625;A delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional .;4
7140;6232;116807;It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and The Laramie Project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in America .;4
7141;7941;146015;For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -LRB- sci-fi -RRB- rehash .;1
7142;2786;55699;Moonlight Mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things .;3
7143;6290;117793;Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .;1
7144;6916;128567;Flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old Jack Nicholson could be looking at his 12th Oscar nomination by proving that he 's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary .;4
7145;4162;80755;In addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- Lilo & Stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .;4
7146;7754;142870;Bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie .;2
7147;4868;93318;While Scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` Gangs '' is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about .;1
7148;4395;85005;has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs .;3
7149;5885;111042;The film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .;1
7150;7444;137597;The little girls understand , and McCracken knows that 's all that matters .;3
7151;3342;65886;What might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .;1
7152;1663;35373;The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .;1
7153;1859;38957;If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .;1
7154;6645;123750;McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .;0
7155;8434;154323;The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .;2
7156;4181;81160;Duvall is strong as always .;4
7157;747;17217;Low comedy does n't come much lower .;1
7158;4461;86173;This 90-minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson 's E !;0
7159;6301;117957;A movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes Battlefield Earth and Showgirls .;0

7161;8225;150881;Fortunately , Elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry .;3
7162;2260;46497;Amazingly dopey .;3
7163;2363;48389;Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .;1
7164;2430;49592;`` Me Without You '' is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades .;2
7165;828;18867;The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . '';1

7170;5638;106744;The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .;0
7171;8059;148070;The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers .;2
7172;2127;43876;Infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by Diane Lane .;4
7173;6918;128623;Its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch .;3
7174;3702;72436;Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .;1

7374;414;9881;Cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression .;3
7375;5904;111333;Saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion .;2
7376;6886;128011;-LRB- MacDowell -RRB- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .;0
7377;7879;145047;I found myself liking the film , though in this case one man 's treasure could prove to be another man 's garbage .;2
7378;8082;148533;Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .;0
7379;623;14458;An hour and a half of joyful solo performance .;4
7380;2599;52506;Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .;1
7381;1736;36663;Some movies blend together as they become distant memories .;2
7382;5613;106310;Everyone 's insecure in Lovely and Amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .;4
7383;1404;30232;It has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .;3
7384;5100;97532;Video games are more involving than this mess .;1
7385;2511;51008;The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .;1
7386;3407;67117;The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .;1
7387;4570;87977;director Hoffman , his writer and Kline 's agent should serve detention;0
7388;4005;77869;A thought-provoking picture .;4
7389;5592;105924;Seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-Shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil .;3
7390;5499;104238;Those of you who do n't believe in Santa Claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original .;2
7391;2702;54372;A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .;2
7392;2371;48516;Cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film 's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein 's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of Denmark 's Dogma movement .;3
7393;7301;135230;... too sappy for its own good .;1
7394;1038;22939;Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .;1
7395;303;7452;Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .;3
7396;3212;63471;Clint Eastwood 's Blood Work is a lot like a well-made PB & J sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same .;3
7397;224;5627;The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .;1
7398;552;12818;While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .;0
7399;6884;127970;I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .;0
7400;1509;32213;It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .;2
7401;1334;28774;Trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease .;2
7402;3910;76211;Just like Igby .;2
7403;3491;68697;Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .;1
7404;2492;50671;Schrader examines Crane 's decline with unblinking candor .;3
7405;1326;28653;Nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining .;3
7406;2246;46144;Go for La Salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .;2
7407;4863;93260;This is n't a new idea .;1
7408;1261;27457;The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .;0
7409;6449;120599;Holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life 's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks .;4
7410;3274;64675;It 's one long bore .;1
7411;4114;79850;Raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings .;4
7412;1627;34627;What begins as a film in the tradition of The Graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .;2
7413;8464;154740;Familiar but utterly delightful .;3
7414;6322;118342;An engrossing Iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed .;3
7415;5668;107261;Adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of Orlean 's themes without being a true adaptation of her book .;3
7416;6086;114423;You 'd think by now America would have had enough of plucky British eccentrics with hearts of gold .;2
7417;6094;114553;Bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time .;3
7418;6387;119455;Less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself .;2
7419;4615;88833;It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .;1
7420;6508;121483;Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .;0
7421;3996;77700;This is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .;2
7422;4049;78680;It 's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime .;3
7423;6287;117757;Like the best of Godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable .;4
7424;7766;143067;Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .;1
7425;4989;95545;It 's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing .;4
7426;987;21995;Bland but harmless .;1
7427;4819;92527;The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . '';1
7428;2868;56999;Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .;2
7429;3508;69047;It 's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .;3
7430;6538;121964;Now he makes them .;2
7431;5927;111670;Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .;1
7432;2678;53938;Scotland , PA is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept .;1
7433;2233;45909;The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .;1
7434;1165;25462;I like that Smith , he 's not making fun of these people , he 's not laughing at them .;3
7435;345;8287;The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .;3
7436;3560;69972;Surprisingly insightful;3
7437;7043;130725;"If it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with Ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .";3
7438;3290;64988;Lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that Brown played in American culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability .;3
7439;5881;110989;A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .;0
7440;2946;58459;The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .;2
7441;2329;47780;This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .;0
7442;2386;48864;Great over-the-top moviemaking if you 're in a slap-happy mood .;4
7443;4611;88751;Rifkin 's references are ... impeccable throughout .;4
7444;1823;38300;This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .;1
7445;5335;101438;There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .;2
7446;5478;103879;Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .;2
7447;5465;103615;It will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .;3
7448;3644;71434;Made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because -LRB- Solondz 's -RRB- cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .;2
7449;3734;73085;Mama Africa pretty much delivers on that promise .;3
7450;2654;53530;Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .;0
7451;4730;90911;It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy .;1
7452;5062;96853;Bouquet gives a performance that is masterly .;4
7453;7835;144315;Sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story .;1
7454;7074;131256;A family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .;2
7455;6517;121591;There 's nothing like love to give a movie a B-12 shot , and CQ shimmers with it .;4
7456;3775;73797;I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .;1
7457;6230;116798;It 's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .;4
7458;3176;62784;Hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining .;4
7459;6065;114068;While certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , Jeong-Hyang Lee 's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .;2
7460;4154;80664;Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in New York .;1
7461;3939;76588;May take its sweet time to get wherever it 's going , but if you have the patience for it , you wo n't feel like it 's wasted yours .;3
7462;5367;101965;The film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side .;4
